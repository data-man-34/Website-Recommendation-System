"on April 2, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moto G5 Plus not connecting to my Computer! FIXED!,"[NOTE: ISSUE FIXED! SEE BELOW] I like this phone and want it work, so I am wondering if this is a flaw in ALL Moto G5 phones or just the two that I have tested, or what?  I have had no similar issues with previous other brands of cell phones. Seeking answers!Got a brand new Moto G5 Plus (the 32 Storage / 2gb model Standard Version) on release day March 31, 2017 and I am all a fluster! I bought it mostly for the super-fast camera recording and that works. Also had no problem connecting with the SIM Card supplied by Ting.My main issue is that when I try to connect to my Windows 10 computer, there seems to be no way to make the PC recognize the darn thing. Yes, a Moto G5 Plus Icon does show up in Windows, however, it is empty inside, so there is no way to pull photos off the phone, and I would guess that it would be impossible to back it up. I did try different cables as well as a few other PCs including a Mac with same results.I did call Amazon tech support and he ran me through every possible fix as well as downloading Motorola drivers; all of which did not fix the issue. Figuring it might be a bad phone, I ordered another one: the 64 Storage / 4gb model Standard Version.  Also tried different Micro SD Cards. Seemed to make no difference in trying to find the pictures to get them off the phone and onto the computer.............................4/02/2017 UPDATE: EUREKA! I finally found that elusive ""Transfer Button"" called USB for Photo Transfer, however it was not in the place where you'd expect to find it!  It was mixed in with what I would characterize as a bunch of ""messages"" with a white backgrounds. So it just looks like another email or text notification message. I am changing my 2 Star Review to 4 Stars for all the trouble I had in figuring this out. Even the tech support guy did not know the answer to this!"
"on May 22, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price on a very good phone. This will work on Verizon network (despite what they say).,"This was my first purchase of an unlocked phone, so I was a bit nervous as I am not always comfortable with technology.  The most challenging part of using the phone was getting someone at Verizon to realize that this phone is supported by their network. If you get similar push back from them, simply take the SIM card out of your current phone and put it in this one.  The phone worked right away and I'm very happy so far.Beautiful 1080p screen. I love that it has fingerprint detection.  For me there's always a learning curve with a new phone (I tend to buy phones from different manufacturer's), but so far this one has been easy to use."
"on November 24, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for the price point,"I've had this phone for a month and a half now and I'm quite happy with it.  I had been using a flip phone (really) because we live in an area with poor cell reception.  But when we closed that account, I decided to take the plunge.  This phone has a lot of features I couldn't find on many phones with this price point - like a gyroscope so you can use it with 360 videos and start-chart apps.  I took it to the Verizon store and quickly and painlessly got service w/ no compatibility issues.  It does come with a lot of Google apps, though that was fine by me since I use Google calendar and mail.  It's battery life is pretty good though I'm not an intense user.  But still, I don't need to charge it every night and it doesn't take long to charge when I do.  Phone calls come in clear and when I have a good connection, it runs pretty quickly.  Again, I have nothing to compare to.  I'm sure a high-end Samsung or iPhone is faster, has a better camera, etc., but for a ""starter phone"" this is perfect!"
"on October 10, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fingers crossed the replacement is not also defective  / second one worked right out of the box,"Would not read SIM card out of the box.  AT&T; was not able to get it to work either. Amazon shipping a replacement, but in the meantime, I am without a phone for nearly a week.*Update*  Second phone arrived, works as it should.  No issues with the phone, still working through all of the differences from past phones (mostly Samsung.)  I may grow to like this one better, but I just bought an S7 for one of my sons; at this point, I am wishing I had bought the same for myself.  After six weeks, adding another star.  Good phone, if the first one had worked out of the box, would be five stars.  Happy with the phone."
"on September 9, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,and the screen isn't the greatest. It's far from bad though,"It's kind of big, and the screen isn't the greatest.  It's far from bad though.  The camera is better than serviceable, and better than my point and shoot from 10 years ago.However, the speaker is absolutely pitiful.  The speakerphone on 1/2 volume is about as loud as the earpiece of my previous phone at full volume (LG G3), and the speaker on this phone can be drowned by just a little more than a normal conversation.  Call quality is also poor over Sprint's network, but that's probably just Sprint's issue because hangouts calls are better (but still not great).  It also has pretty major slowdown issues with the stock Google search/google now app, and the search field hangs for a few seconds (you can type, it just doesn't show everything until it's through the hangup).Bottom line, if it was lost, broken, or stolen, I would replace it with an older phone at a similar pricepoint.  It's nice, but not full price nice."
"on July 3, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone!,"Great phone.  It works better than my girlfriend's iPhone 6S.  By better, I mean the battery lasts significantly longer and it seems to do things ( e.g opening a program, searching the Internet, etc.) faster.  Also, Android 7 ""Nougat"" is awesome.  I seriously notice how happy I am with this purchase everyday.  And the price is incredible."
"on April 7, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,... was looking for a budget friendly phone with a great camera. I really wanted the iPhone 7,"I was looking for a budget friendly phone with a great camera.  I really wanted the iPhone 7, but I couldn't justify spending that much money.  After looking at reviews from reliable sites, I noticed this phone.  Based on the price and the reviews posted, I decided to go for it.  The camera is great! I've been impressed and believe it will do what I have been looking for.I use it as a Verizon prepaid device and did have to go get a $20 SIM card for it.  The Verizon store took care of me and went ahead and moved my service from my previous phone to this phone."
"on June 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Phone - Reasonable Cost,"This is an excellent phone for the money.  It has all the bells and whistles and the latest android os.  I'm only charging the battery once a day and it is only at half full when I charge it.  It could easily make it into the second day before charging.  Also, the battery charges quickly to full, if you only have a short time to charge it and want to have a full battery as you walk out the door.  The screen is bright and the resolution is great.  The camera takes great photos.  This phone replaced one I broke that cost me easily three times as much and, after using this phone, I wouldn't go back."
"on September 23, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, well worth the money","I've only owned this phone for a few days, but I can honestly say this is the happiest I've ever been with a smartphone purchase. This phone fast enough to handle your everyday apps - twitter, facebook, reddit, chrome, imgur, etc. Has enough memory to multitask multiple apps at once without ever needing to forceably close one (I can run a twitch stream on high quality while google music plays in the background). The battery life is absolutely phenomenal, especially when compared to my previous phone (the terrible Nexus 5x). Charging is fast and reliable. The screen is great. Fingerprint reader works well enough, and the form factor is straight and to the point. Can't forget the 64gb of storage either - I've thrown multiple albums on this thing and I still have plenty of space left over. If you're looking for a great phone at a decent cost I can't recommend this one enough. Just like my first smartphone, the original Moto G, I imagine I'll be holding onto this one for a long time."
"on April 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice upgrade and the amazon adds are not an issue,"I bought this for my mom as an upgrade from moto X gen 2.  She is very happy with it so far (2 weeks in).  Battery life is better than expected, and the Amazon adds have not proved to be a problem.  I don't have experience with the camera to report at this time but the phone seems snappy and responsive.  Although some have reported issues with the SIM install, I didn't have a problem.  The fit is tight indeed which might lead you to question if you are putting it in correctly.  We didn't install an SD card yet.  Her previous phone had 16Gb with no SD card slot so it was getting full but moving up to 64G may be enough without the SD card.  I do believe that the 2nd sim slot was blocked on the carrier on the model we got."
"on July 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,"I had a Moto g from Verizon which over the years became very slow. I chose the Moto G5 64GB and 4 GB of Ram. It was seamless for me. Went to the Verizon store, they stuck in a SIM and away I went, even saved $5 on the monthly plan. I've only had it about a week but it's worked perfectly. For me, so far, it has been a great experience. I also went with Amazon ads for the savings as I am  a Prime member."
"on June 6, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Phone,I'd give it five stars except when the nano card was put in it got stuck and cost 125.00 for a company to get it out. Be very careful how you put the cards in. It's a bad design. Other than that fiasco the phone has worked fine since.
"on April 25, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Close to 5*. Very attractive flagship alternative.,"This might make it to 5* if Lenovo/Motorola provides timely updates to fix a few issues. My Droid Turbo broke, and I needed a new phone. I have a few basic requirements:1. Good battery life2. Excellent call capability3. Ability to play some mobile games (not the most advanced, but still need some oomph)4. Productivity capable - email, decent camera (pics for work projects), decent size screen, etc.I have typically bought 1-2 year old flagship devices and used them for another year or two. I read lots of positive reviews on this device and the Amazon branded model has a nifty discount so I took the jump and ordered one. Here's my impressions:1. It's fast. switching and loading apps is much faster than the Droid Turbo2. The fingerprint scanner (I have to have a locked device for work) is great! Plus, enabling one-button nav in ""Moto Actions"" saves screen real-estate and works very slick!3. Enabling VoLTE was easy using a guide, so HD voice and simultaneous voice/data is a go. Since it's unlocked, it doesn't support native voice calling through my Carrier (VZW), but you could always use a third-party app.4. Lenovo patched a 911 bug REALLY FAST. We will see about Android 7.1 and security updates (security patch is Jan 2017)5. The gBoard keyboard will barf after a few days. Gets REALLY slow and phone just locks up. Rebooting fixes it for a few days. It's more of an annoyance, but my Droid Turbo could go weeks without needed a reboot.6. Battery life is quite good. I play about 2 hours of mobile games a day, and I can easily get a day and a half. My Turbo could only make it until dinner time. So 2x batter life. Turbo charging is AWESOME!There you go!"
"on April 5, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,First time Motorola user!,"I love phones and learning everything I can about them. The screen in any light is visible, it is also the perfect size. It runs like a dream but like any other phone it has hiccups. The back camera is more than your money bargained for, which is awesome. As for the front camera I was severely let down. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sub $300 device."
"on May 31, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,High end features in mid-priced phone - works seamlessly with Tracfone service,"This is the nicest smartphone that I've owned. OK, that's not saying much, since my prior phones were all Tracfone phones. But comparing this to my wife's One Plus One, I like this one better. I'm still using this phone with Tracfone, which works great on this by the way. I just ordered a SIM card from Tracfone, put it in, and everything worked great when I transferred my service from my old phone to this one online. In my area, Tracfone uses Verizon for my network. They may use a different network in your area.  This phone seems very fast with no noticeable lag when running apps. It's great that it's running Android 7.0, so it has many useful years ahead of it. The fingerprint reader is a great feature to have. I supplemented it with the AppLock Android app, so I can require a fingerprint to run any particular app I want. Battery life seems great. I can use the phone all day and still have half a battery charge left. The camera's low light performance is the only weak area of this phone. The pictures are great in normal light, and I really like the manual control that you can have with the built in camera app. But the camera does not take RAW images and in low light, such as a dimly lighted restaurant, the pictures are dark. This can be partially remedied in post-processing, On the plus side, the camera is quick to respond. You press the exposure button and the picture is taken almost instantly. In past phones, memory was always a problem. Now that I have 64 GB, I have room for as many apps as I want. I supplemented this with a 128 GB micro SD card for data. Now I never have to worry about memory. I got the Amazon Prime Exclusive version and find the small ads on the lock screen to be unobtrusive. These only show up when you initially wake the phone from sleep mode. Glad I went that route and saved some money.  Bottom line is I'm very happy with my Motorola G5 Plus and am glad I bought it. It seems like a much better deal than anything else out there right now. I also find the Tracfone service to work well and seamlessly with this phone. For those like myself, who don't use a lot of talk minutes, you can't beat $10 per GB of data usage on top of about $7 per month for the phone service.UPDATE 10/26/2017: Have been using this phone for 6 months now and I absolutely love it. The fingerprint sensor makes it so easy to use, I'd never buy another phone without this feature. I find the phone takes better videos than my expensive camera. The way I use the phone, I never see any of the Amazon ads, so that's definitely the way to go. I find myself using my tablet less now, with this phone allowing me to do everything I want. Didn't even take my tablet on our recent trip. I have received several automatic security patches from Motorola since my purchase, so they do support this phone."
"on November 21, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding phone!,"6 months in: Girlfriend still loves her G5 Plus! Nice gold finish on the metal chassis, feels great in-hand. Has a crisp, vivid screen and the camera is good! Her photos will not rival those taken with a recent iPhone or Galaxy phone, and there is a noticeable delay when you hit the shutter button while trying to capture action shots, but shots are more than good enough for sharing to social media and viewing on-phone. Performance is great, near-pure Android experience, and battery life is outstanding! Very well-balanced device for the money - not a benchmark champion but a nice phone for regular people, and unlocked so you can switch service providers and keep costs down. Check it out!"
"on September 17, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this phone! Great for the price!,"A great package for the money! I got mine from Warehouse Deals as ""Used, Like New"", and saved 25% off the list price. It was in pristine condition as described, so this seems to have paid off. This is the 64Gb storage / 4Gb RAM model. Love the stock Nougat and the Moto extensions. There is an option to let the fingerprint reader do double duty for navigation. When this option is on, the standard Android circle/square/triangle icons disappear, which adds a little screen real estate. It's super convenient to use so that feature alone makes this phone worth consideration.The UI is slick and responsive and the battery lasts all day and then some. It's not cutting edge or sexy in any way, so if that matters to you look elsewhere. Yes, it has a micro USB instead of a USB C connector, but it does have a headphone jack. I like being able to use the headphones and cables I've already got.Getting it to work with Verizon was a small challenge for the folks at the Verizon store. They couldn't fire up the SIM card without removing Family Base from my account. Overall I like having an unlocked phone, and not having a bunch of apps you don't use and can't get rid of."
"on May 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Impressed,"My business phone is a Galaxy S7 provided from my company, so it's free.  It is an excellent phone.  This one is my personal phone and I PAID FOR IT.  For my personal needs (and budget) It is an excellent phone. I went ""live"" on Facebook when my grandson was eating breakfast and the video was quite good. Pictures are great. The thing is FAST compared to the HTC Desire 610 I had been using.  And transferring everything was easy-peasy using the AT&T; Mobile Transfer.  One thing: I'm not ""on it"" all the time but I make phone calls, send texts, check Facebook, watch the occasional YouTube video; and my battery life is ... well, it's never been below 70% after a day of use, and that's WITHOUT ""battery saving"" mode."
"on September 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value Phone,"Pretty happen with my purchase.  Someone stole my Axon 7 @ EDC and got a LG Stylo 3 which I was very unhappy with - some weird glitch that filled the phone space up with system memory and slowed everything down and wouldn't let me install anything w/o wiping it (had to do this twice)..This phone so far after a few days is a refreshing upgrade to the Stylo..  Much more space, quicker, cleaner OS, shake and spin functions are simple and work well, etc, etc.Plus the Amazon bloat wear's really very tolerable.  You're actually able to just delete the Amazon icons if you don't want them and honestly I only recall an Amazon add pop up once or twice so far..."
"on April 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it!,"I need more stars.  This was a pleasant surprise.  I had 2 G3 phones and my wife has a G4 Plus.  This G5 is orders of magnitude better.  Looks great in the gold colored aluminum case.  I have had a couple of Galaxy phones and this is certainly better than my last one.All these features are better: battery life, speed, display, camera, new guestures with finger print enabled lower button and feel in your hand."
"on April 12, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic phone. I'm recommending it to all my friends and family.,"I don't have a phone fetish and if I didn't need it for work I'd have none at all. But the Moto G5 Plus is the best phone I've ever owned. Tons of storage, RAM to spare, amazing camera, instant fingerprint detection. Charge lasts all day at least."
"on April 14, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent phone,"Had some initial issues. After after days it would not send or receive pictures (MMS). Went to T-Mobile, then Motorola customer service, no joy. Then tried a factory reset which (1) solved the problem and (2) induced a major operating system upgrade. Still runs Android 7.0 with a security patch of January, but all issues are gone.Charges very fast, and battery lasts much longer than my Asus Zenphone2. Fingerprint recognition is very fast.Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that it lacks a notification light which I miss.  Have not yet found an good app work around for notifications of calls, texts, etc."
"on November 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,I would buy it again,"Not an extremely tech-savvy person. Didn't want an IPhone. This is great for me. It does all I need it to and quickly. I used the device help button a lot in the beginning. I wish there would be an instruction manual but I suppose that gives my age away. I dropped the phone once from a height of about four feet. The""durable"" cover that was supposed to be do great broke into pieces but the phone was fine."
"on June 5, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything in the G Plus works like a charm,Bought it to replace my old Motorola because the camera does not work after about 1 year. Everything in the G Plus works like a charm. The camera is a marked improvement over my old one (when it worked). Syned it with my wife's Honda Android Auto without a hitch. Likewise with my car's blue tooth.The Verizon store actually used the old Sim card from my other Motorola and installed it in the G Plus and it worked. So far I am very happy with the purchase.
"on May 21, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone for the Price,"I have not had any problems with the phone. I had a Moto X second generation that I was replacing due to a failing battery.  I am on Verizon and I simply removed the SIM Card from the Moto X and inserted it into the Moto G5, powered up the phone and it was immediately on the Verizon network. The battery life is excellent. I am a fairly heavy user and the battery normally has 70% remaining at the end of the day.  The speed and performance is very similar to my Moto X.  The G5 doesn't have NFC but I never used that on my Moto X, so that wasn't an issue for me. I like the phone and would buy it again."
"on September 27, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone low price,"I have had this phone for nearly 2 months and still can't believe what a great phone it is for the price.  It has most of the features the premium phones do with a low price and it's unlocked, which means I can change service providers without having to by a new phone. Also love only shelling out $300 vs $700 to $800 for a premium phone like the Samsung S8 or iPhone.  So if you are NOT looking for the latest and greatest features this phone will fit your needs.The only negative I have noticed is that the volume on the timer starts out very low for 1 to 2 seconds then goes up to normal volume.  I do not know if this is by design or a flaw.Still loving this phone!"
"on June 13, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Device,"Ordered the 64GB version since my previous Samsung was on 8GB which resulted in nlt having much room for apps. This phone has plenty of storage especially when adding a SD card. I use Walmart Family mobile and the phone has performed well including having WIfi calling feature. The only downfall is no NFC on US based Moto G5 Plus but I can live with out the feature. Phone is fast, accurate a pleasure to own."
"on April 7, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"I am in love with this phone.  For the money, this is the best phone available."
"on December 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,It's not $1000!,Love my new phone. I couldn't bring myself to pay what I would for a computer. So I opted for this and it does everything I need from a cell phone. No problems so far and I could switch from Boost to Boom! which means I went from the Sprint network to Verizon which offers better reception where I work but I don't have to pay Verizon prices. I pay half of what I would pay but I'm still using a good network.
"on June 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,"I had a Moto x 1st gen so I liked the brand but it was time to upgrade. I'm still learning tips and tricks (I'm old don't ya know, takes awhile) but I love my new phone. I'm using it on my Republic Wireless account and it works great."
"on April 11, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Top-Tier Phone with Budget Price,"I ordered the MOTO G5 PLUS after searching for around 9 months for a solid replacement for my Nexus 4. Initially I had held out hope for a new Nexus phone, but the creation of the PIXEL line, that hope was dashed. This is the new flagship for what a budget Android phone can be and it does it well in all regards.Camera: The camera is fantastic. At first, I was quite wary of the lack of more megapixels but that fear was unfounded. The combination of larger pixel size and f/1.7 allows you to take solid pictures in most light settings. Wile this camera does not compare with the cameras on the PIXEL or the newest iphone, it is equivalent to a flagship phone of one or two years ago. It performs well in low light settings, and is very good in all others, there are 2k photo options, slo-mo video, and continuous photo taking modes. Two features about the camera stand out. The first is the ease of opening the camera app. With two quick twists of your wrist, the camera app opens, regardless of what was going on with the phone. This allows you to quickly capture any photo instantly. The other is the exposure setting. By clicking on the screen you can then adjust how much light is taken in. This allows for better low light photos, or the ability to take photos when there is a very bright background. Most of my friends with iphones and other top tier phones have been jealous of this setting.Battery Life: Very solid. I can easily go two days without needing to charge my phone, and regularly do. When I use my phone intensely(like playing games on it all day) I still get a full days use out of it. The quick charging also brings the battery back to 50% within 20 minutes, enabling you to use your pone without fear of the battery dying.Screen: This is the only downside to the phone, and the downside is small. With 1080p and 424PPI, the phone performs solidly in most every situation. The two that it does not is for VR and in screen brightness. The screen is not good enough to be used with google daydream and other VR devices. And in full sun, the max brightness setting does not quite eliminate all glare. These two problems are small in my book, and otherwise the screen looks great.Aesthetics: This budget phone really excels in looks and feel. The 5.2 inch screen feels good in the hand, and can be used easily with one hand(at least I can with my 8"" hand-span). The body is metal with a plastic trim and looks like a top tier phone, but with most people using cases, this matters less. It's raised back for the camera really stands out and makes the phone look great. On the front there is a small MOTO symbol above the screen, which is a little annoying but pretty much invisible in day-to-day use. Overall, I could not complain about a single thing in looks/feel.Finger-Print Scanner: To be honest, I thought that I would not use this feature at all and that it was completely unnecessary. Boy was I wrong. This is one of the stand out features of the phone. The scanner is on the front of the phone, below the screen and is easy to use for all its features. First of all, it unlocks the phone with great reliability and security. It also can act as the home, back, menu, screen lock, and google assistant button. Now I know that sounds like a lot of features for a single button, but the way Motorola has set it up is quite intuitive and simple. By using the scanner as the back, home, and menu button, you also free up more space on your screen effectively giving you a larger screen size. The way Motorola has set this up is amazing and should be replicated on other phones.OS: The G5 Plus runs Nougat 7.0 out of the box, and it is great. While not much changes from previous versions of Android, everything runs quite smoothly and without any hiccups. The G5 Plus comes with almost no bloatware, which is a big plus. It runs stock Android and only has one Motorola app, Moto. Moto is essential to the phone since it allows you to customize which gestures you want activated, and how you want to use the finger print scanner.Cost: Another big plus of the phone. This phone is easily the best phone in it's price category, competing with phones ranging from $400-$500. This fact alone should make you buy this phone if you are at all considering it.Ads or not: I personally chose not to go with the ads. The added layer of Amazon overtop the Android OS is unappealing as far as performance goes and the lock screen ads seem distracting. This phone is already very cheap for what you get so I'd say there is no need to put the ads on it.Which version: With the availability of a Micro-SD slot, the only thing the upgraded phone really does for you is change the RAM from 2Gb to 4Gb. While this will future proof the phone for a bit longer, the cost of doing so is not worth the gains. I'd rather save the money and buy a future Motorola phone since I hope they continue to make such high quality phones.If you are at all considering this phone, then you should buy it. It is the best budget phone for its time that has come out in years and is well worth its price. I have already had 2 friends buy this phone after playing around with mine, and I couldn't recommend it more highly."
"on May 25, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,My phone works well for everything I ask of it ...,"My phone works well for everything I ask of it, except for when I make calls. It has serious clarity issues. About half to two thirds of the time, the sound on calls skips in and out multiple times per second."
"on November 11, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Budget Buy,"Great price.  Fast.  Nice screen.  Fingerprint sensor control convenient once I stopped looking for home and navigation buttons.  Plain vanilla Android, lacking features you may expect that are available in customized Android such as in Samsung phones.  Menus confusing. Of course, my last phone was a Galaxy no number, had to be pried from my fingers."
"on April 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I found it ...,"The Moto Plus G 5th Gen is a good value in a beautifully constructed low price cellphone that is fast and sporting Android 7, the latest version.  The differences between this phone and other models demanding three times the price are minor.  It should be a great international phone when traveling.LIKES:- Charges very fast.- Large battery.- Fast WIFI- Looks like a $700 phone- Fast processor- Amazon advertisements are not intrusive.DISLIKES:- None"
"on April 20, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Currently best in its price range,"I purchased this phone for my mom. She's not a big techie and just wanted the best she could get in the sub $300 range. Further, it had to be compatible with Verizon which limits a lot of the import phones out there. I feel like the Moto G5 Plus fit the bill perfectly.First, we selected the 64gb version mainly because it comes with 4gb of ram as opposed to the 32gb version that only comes with 2gb. I felt like the extended ram would make the phones useful life as well as limit multitasking lag.First impression: I was worried the bezel would look big and imposing by today's standards but in person it isn't bad looking at all. Its no Galaxy S8 but coming in at almost $550 cheaper I cant complain. The default launcher is a bit clunky and the icon and background choice make the screen look washed out and boring. They say first impressions are everything and if Motorola wants to win an easy point here the initial power on should greet you with something that showcases their product. This is easily remedied however with a quick visit to the google play store. My personal choice is the paid version of Nova launcher but I've also found the free Evie launcher to be a great modern looking alternative. Just a personal preference but I'd also switch out the icon theme to a modern look with either Pixel Icon Pack or Rondo. Both are circular themes that fit in well with current modern design trends.Once the phone was setup I found everything to be fast and responsive. This is one of the only ""bargain phones"" I came across to include the latest Android 7.1 N. Overall, its a great user experience.Other points of interest:Camera: I've read it uses the same sony image sensor as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and so far it seems to be one of the strongest selling points. I haven't run it through its paces but the initial results are amazing especially for the price point.Finger print sensor: Quick as any I've ever used. Any delay defeats the purpose in my book and this sensor does the job well. An interesting feature that can be enabled is the ability to use the fingerprint sensor to navigate with swipes. While this might not sound useful I was amazed at how intuitive and easy it was to use. Its a feature I now wish other manufactures would implement.Lastly AD's: I hate ads. I'm the type who will pay the premium on apps I use to remove ads as I prefer a clean uncluttered work-space. The Amazon ad discount was probably the single biggest pause I had on this purchase. After using the phone I feel those fears have been eased. The ads only appear on the lock screen and I really feel like they were so unobtrusive that I couldn't justify paying more to just remove them. When I use my phone I may use my lock screen to check the time but otherwise I'm in so quickly the ads are effectively gone.While the phone wasn't a personal purchase I couldn't help but feel like I would be happy using this as my daily driver. You get a lot of bang for the buck especially with the Amazon Prime discount.I'd say if you want:1) an unlocked phone that works on all US carriers2) has the latest operating system3) a fast processor4) great camera5) plenty of memory (64gb plus SD card expandable)6) plenty of ram7) and finally a great pricethen this would be the one to choose."
"on June 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone!!,"Very pleased with this phone.  This is my first cellphone and I'm still learning to use it, but so far, I love this phone.  I use it with Straight Talk with the Verizon nano SIM card.  Great service and we live way out in the country!"
"on October 29, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to my old Samsung Galaxy Note 2, this ...","Compared to my old Samsung Galaxy Note 2, this phone is much more modern. Eight core processor is fast, and 64GB memory is 4X what I used to have. My old phone was getting to be annoyingly slow, don't know the exact reason. But this new Motorola G5+ is much more pleasant to use, fast and responsive, and costs maybe 1/4 of what a new Galaxy Note would."
"on December 1, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone deal out there!,"When other new phones are costing $600 & up, the Moto G5 Plus is an amazing buy. It is every bit as good for almost 1/4 the price! My ONLY criticism, (hence 4 stars), is the fingerprint sensor does not really work very well,,, OR my fingerprints are callused over. I have a difficult time unlocking the phone using this tech. I usually have to use my pass code. Otherwise I am THRILLED with the phone. Once again, Motorola & Lenovo hit it out of the park!"
"on May 5, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Joining the rest of the world with a smartphone.,"Exactly what I was looking for in a phone. Large size is a little difficult to get used to as this is an upgrade from a 2013 style non smart phone. Adjusting has been simple, Android system is easy to use. It's like talking, texting, and photographing on my Samsung tablet only smaller. A great value when compared to similar phones."
"on June 7, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone for the money,"For the price, I couldn't ask for a better phone. Quick, responsive, plenty of memory, and Amazon is very unobtrusive. My spouse has a Samsung S7 and I prefer this phone over that one."
"on November 20, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful,Very impressive hand unit Got it with 64 & 4 GB.(I may get rid of my tablet) I use both CDMA & GSM and I just change sim card and don't even have to reboot. Do wish I could get a U.S.A. dual sim unit with warranty.
"on August 29, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Why pay more when you don't have to,Good Dependable phone I have not had that many issues out of it use it everyday have had numerous expensive name brand phones from other companies and they are on the same level this phone is so why pay more when you don't have to
"on July 20, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Wanted a phone with 4gb ram this one fit the bill, and didn't break the bank. Update..8/25/17.  Not a bad phone but the call quality and battery sucks. If  I have full battery and don't use it at all it will last 7 hrs. I should have kept my honor 5x even after 1 year  a charge would hold 2 and half days."
"on April 26, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best on a budget,"Does exactly what I need. Space to download plenty of apps, SD card slot so I can load up my music and podcasts. It has incredible battery life so far, I charge it for maybe 10 minutes each day if I think about it. It was also important to me to get a good quality phone that I could buy outright and not be locked into some unnecessary monthly charges."
"on July 20, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best smartphone I could have purchased,"The best smartphone I could have purchased. Don't just take my word for how great this phone is, YouTube has several reviews of the Moto G 5 plus. Thank you Amazon for the chance to own this excellent smartphone!"
"on July 20, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,but seems to have good battery life and display is clear and crisp,"Since my Nexus 5 finally bit the dust (speaker went out), I needed a reasonably priced replacement.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It's a bit larger than the Nexus 5, but seems to have good battery life and display is clear and crisp.  Of course, there's the hours of tweaking setups to get things to behave as before..."
"on May 24, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moto G5,I really like this phone. It has enough horsepower to run some critical apps that I use involving cad drawings on site.It has a good battery life. Easily lasting all day under heavy use.So far this the best phone I've had.
"on August 22, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone for small price,"Great phone. Good battery life, responsive, no locks, easy to install sim and MicroSD. No complaints!Lock screen adds on the Amazon ad enabled version doesn't annoy me one bit and dropped the price a ton!"
"on August 29, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,I love the functionality of the phone,"I love the functionality of the phone. Really like it. But....it always crashes on me. Has to do these reboots, freezes up, etc."
"on April 8, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the phone,"I like the phone.  I replaced a LG G3 with this phone and performance is at least equal to it.  I don't use the phone for a lot other than games, social media and texting so I don't really require a lot of processing power, so I'm not sure how well the phone would hold up under heavy usage.  I do know that my G3 would get very warm to the touch when playing some games, however this phone has not done that at all yet.There are a few things that I wish it had that are minor.  For one, there doesn't appear to be any indicator light allowing you to know if you have a text or email without picking up the phone and waking it.  Also, this one is very minor, but the mobile data and wifi do not have status arrow to allow you to know if data is being transferred.  I may have to get a new texting app as the one that came pre-installed does a weird link to a picture that I sent to my wife.For the good side of things.  The battery is good.  On a full charge, I went 18 hours or so before getting to about 25%.  This included about 8+ of playing music through bluetooth in my work truck, miscellaneous web browsing and game playing.  I like the moto gestures, like turning on the flashlight with a double chop of the phone.  The build of the phone feels good. Also, the Amazon ads are almost unnoticeable.  It's a matter of saving $60 or getting to have a picture of my kids as a lock screen.I am a Verizon customer.  I have read people have had trouble getting it to activate on the Verizon network.  I picked up a nano-sim from my local retailer since my G3 had a micro-sim.  I tried activating it online through the self-activation link, but for some reason it would not recognize the new sim card number so I preceded to chat with a rep, and she had it activated in about 5 minutes.Overall, very satisfied purchasing this phone through Amazon over being stuck making payments for a phone to Verizon."
"on November 28, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone itself is great, beautiful picture","This phone itself is great, beautiful picture, crisp sound, excellent photos. However, I took it to Verizon to get my Sim card inserted and the Sim card/ SD reader is defective and destroyed every Sim card inserted. Also, the charging port is defective and wouldn't accept the cord sent in the box with the phone. Like it wouldn't fit. Biggest disappointment seeing as I've been without a phone for almost a month and finally was able to buy myself a phone, only to have to send it back the next day. Returning, hoping for a replacement that isn't defective."
"on April 30, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is a freaking steal. Also it's a great phone. SO much built in, stock android with moto features that make it BETTER.","Couldn't be happier. This is an absolute steal for the price. Perfect size. A Decent screen I mean it's not as good as you can get but very decent. The camera works great. The video is in 6k or whatever that rate is that is more than most humans need. Ads are not intrusive at all in fact if you set up your fingerprint correctly and learn to use it you will skip past it mostly before you even see it. If a 5.2 inch screen seems small consider that you can set it up to use the fingerprint scanner to replace the normal navigation buttons (Back, Home, Recent). The buttons are on screen, not dedicated buttons, you can remove them completely.Pictures: Take phone from pocket purse etc, twist twice without opening device, camera is now on. Missed shots? Doubtful.Camera: Default is rear facing, same motion (twist twice) and it flips to front (or back depending). Has a good set of controls, HTR I am still figuring out but it seems to work. Expert mode has faster response in my opinion. Regular mode you can still control ""exposure"" with a finger. Fast zoom, good focus. Panorama and slo-mo work fine. Video quality is excellent.WiFi calling works great.Can't tell you about the nearfield or whatever it's called, have not and probably will not set that up. I'm not even sure if it has it in fact I think it does not. If you can't tell I could care less about that feature. I already carry a wallet.Basically stock android (that's a good thing). Moto/Lenovo did not put much on top of it, and what they did makes it work better with the actual device.When open say ""ok google"" and ask your question and it works. Pretty cool. ""Hey wiretap can cat's eat pancakes?"" yeah nothing could possibly go wrong here. ""Ok google order tinfoil hats, stat!""Look for the price, $230, you get an Octocore 64GB/4GB device with a good call quality (sound) dual sim capable, memory card capable, fast charging, long lasting battery, great device. Well set up, non intrusive ads, and lets face it if you are ordering it from Amazon anyway you likely have prime (for all the benifits, video books music, music storage (yes even your own take that itunes) etc etc, all that stuff is installed. Well except music. I think. Anyway it comes with a lot of amazon applications installed. For all this alone it's worth it.For people like me.... well that's a whole other story. Here is what I am upgrading FROM... a HTC EVO4G (HTC Supersonic). The original 4G phone sold in the united states. Top of the line at its time, but terrible battery so with a seidio 3000 ma/hr super case etc and I guess about 4 years of rooted tweaked roms I still used it up until a few days ago. So this phone, for a LOT less than I paid for the EVO, still will have longevity. Why? Octocore. 64 GB storage built in, with up to 128 gb card you can add. THAT is a lot of distance you can go before even starting to root the thing which I have no intention of doing until I need to. I mean it's a 2GHZ processor. I think the GPU is like 650 which is fine.Look if you plan on playing 3d games etc, maybe upgrade from this but I tried a couple just for kicks and they work. This isn't a flagship phone. But it's VERY good. Music over bluetooth sounds good. Speaker is a little tinny so what. Who doesn't own a bluetooth speaker these days?? Right wiretap I mean Alexa? Not you ok google. Between cats a dog and two NSA listening devices it's not really talking to yourself anyway.IF however you are an average user, want a decent camera, fast processor, etc, it's a great phone. I was worried I would miss some features. I don't. Just buy it, it's worth every penny."
"on June 17, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the phone,Love the phone.  It's been great so far and has good battery life.  I researched a lot and yes I could have bought a better one but it would have cost me twice as much.  I'm glad that I took it to the Verizon store to have it activated (for free) instead of buying a SIM and trying to do it myself.
"on June 8, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"I bought this phone for my sister and liked it so much I wanted one for myself. I was astounded that I couldn't buy a second one. For me, the solution was easy: have my sister buy one for me using her account. (I kept the first one and set up the second one for her.) So be aware that if you want to buy multiple Amazon-ad versions of this phone, you might be restricted to just one per account.If you don't want to spend several hundred dollars on a smart phone but want a high quality device that's responsive, feature-rich, but not full of bloat-ware, this phone is ideal.In no particular order, these are some of the features I really like or am impressed with:* Long battery life. Particularly when turning off the cell radio when on WiFi (putting it in airplane mode then re-enabling the WiFi), this phone lasts a long time even when using it heavily. I can comfortably use it all day without worrying about the battery dying or having to recharge.* The phone is really responsive, and even with the 2GB version, it never feels like it's overwhelmed.* No bloatware. I haven't checked to see if you can delete the Amazon apps, but those are pretty much the only apps that are ""bloatish"". Lenovo does put their ""Moto"" app on, which allows you to turn on the fingerprint reader for gestures.* The G5 Plus runs Nougat, the most recent iteration of the Android operating system, and most others in this price range, and many that are more expensive, still run Marshmallow. So far, I really like Nougat. I briefly considered purchasing the LG phone, but I purchased an LG tablet a bit over a year ago which, while I like, was never updated from Lollipop to Marshmallow, so I lacked any faith that the phone would be upgraded.* I love the gesture-enabled fingerprint reader. Placing it on the front of the device increases its utility. I read one professional review of the G5 Plus yesterday that said it was hard to get used to and the reviewer preferred the traditional separate control buttons. (You don't have to enable the gesture feature of the reader if you don't like it.) I'm not a fan of a lot of gesture controls and rarely use them in apps, but I took to the fingerprint reader gestures easily and found them natural and intuitive. Reader gestures consist of: return to home; open cards with previous/recent apps; swipe back to previous screen; open Google search assistant; sleep/turn off the screen. After just a couple hours, the gestures became instinctive. The only two that took a bit longer was distinguishing opening Google and turning off the screen, since I would sometimes accidentally open Google instead of turning off the screen. However, even that took less than a day to master.* The build quality is excellent. The metal back is very nice. There are a few plastic bits, but most of the body is metal. The screen is smooth and responsive. It's lightweight but sturdy-feeling and fits well even in my smallish hand. The image quality is great with true colors, great brightness, and sharp details.* The camera takes excellent photos and gives the user a lot of controls for exposure, etc., that used to be only available on much more expensive devices. Even in an almost-dark room, it takes good pictures.I'd definitely recommend this phone to anyone. If you have a bit more money, get the one with 4GB of RAM, but this one will please you if the 4GB version is out of your price range."
"on July 24, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is quite literally the best budget phone you could ask for,"This is quite literally the best budget phone you could ask for. After spending many hours looking at similar phones I finally decided this one to be my best bet. The battery life is incredible, the speaker is loud and sounds good, absolutely no lag during use and charges super quick. The camera is a bit lacking in quality but I mean for the rest of the phone to work as well as it does for the price I can't complain in the least bit. I am absolutely impressed."

"on April 17, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter gets a kick out of the fingerprint scanner.,Bought this for my daughter who briefly owned a Moto G4 but it had charging problems so we sent it back. She says the G5 is even better and that she really likes it. The fingerprint thing tickles her pink.
"on April 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,"Bought 64 gig with ads. Replaced my Moto x pure which quit on me after only 15 months of use and a multitude of battery life issues that began after updates were installed. I was swearing off Motorola products after my experience but there are not many choices for Carrier friendly phones. So far I love this phone, the Sim card from my old phone was a snap to install and Verizon is working fine, no issues as of yet. I kind of don't like the issues regarding one's privacy with Google but on the other hand everything on my old phone was a breeze to transfer. I was also hesitant to get the version with ads but  I use Amazon alot and saved $60 over the non ad version. The ads are barely noticeable for me. As of this writing I would definitely recommend this phone, I will update the review if my opinion changes."
"on May 22, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone.,"Great Phone...I love Motorola products and this one didn't let me down. I was a little skeptical about buying this on Amazon, but when I saw it comes directly from Motorola I just went for it!"

"on April 12, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the phone; but hate the SIM tray design,"I have been a Motorola fan for years, going back to the original RZRs, and this is an inexpensive upgrade from my Moto Droid Turbo.  However, the SIM tray on this phone is a disaster.  I was afraid that I was going to break the latch holding the tray because I had to push so hard to release it.  Once I got it released, it was hard to remove.  Once I got it removed, it was hard to seat the SIM card and the SD card.  Once I got them seated properly, it was hard to push the tray back into the slot.  I had read comments from other users who had not seated them correctly and had gotten them lodged inside the device.  Fortunately, I managed to get it right and the phone worked properly.  Hopefully I will never have to remove the SIM again.  Other than the poorly designed SIM card tray, I love the phone.  It was delivered on time and packaging was excellent.  Price was great and insurance was much cheaper than through my carrier."

High res screen2. Gyroscopic featureSo I bought the 4GB/64GB version of the Moto G Plus (5th Generation) and received it yesterday.  I took both phones to my local Verizon store and was able to transfer my prepaid account over to the new device.  The G5 uses a different sim card but after a few minutes they got things sorted out.  I've used the phone for several hours playing around with virtual reality and 3D movies.  Wow, is that fun and it looks great, too!I actually really like the finger print sensor to unlock the phone, too.  I'm a very happy camper at this point and the phone, while more expensive than my usual < $100 devices, was well worth the price."

Overall I am happy with pic quality.  I do not like the photo edit because the is no option to write or draw on the pic.  The battery last, that is a big plus for me.  I stream music all day at work, email, text, and social media and do not have to charge till evening.I have the ad phone and they are really no problem for me.  The small ad that is cool on the home screen, I just moved to its own screen way in the back.  The lock screen ad is not a problem,.

Also the phone charges full in a half hour. Full of cleaver features. Get the 4gig ram, larger storage. The Amazon adds are not that irritating, only appear on the lock screen when unlocked and save $60."
"on December 7, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moto5 g plus,"Like it a lot. Does everything better than my Grand Prime Samsung. Great phone, good price."
"on April 4, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang for the buck!,"This is my 3rd Moto as I have increased generations and memory with each. My G3 was only 8GB and was upgraded to the G4/16GB Prime phone as soon as it was available. This time went to 64GB to put storage and performance issues behind me.  I loved the G4 and this G5 is even better. I love going to camera mode with the twist  of my wrist and flashlight mode with a hatchet chop. To me, the Amazon ads are non-intrusive and are well worth the $60 saving. Google transferred my apps as soon as I logged onto Google and I just moved the SD card from the G4 to the G5 to move photos and music. I did have a hassle with the nano SIM and the micro SD cards as the directions were far from clear, but a video on YouTube got me straight.  I love the fingerprint reader as a touch of my right or left forefinger unlocks my phone which is so much easier than entering my pin number on the G4.  The camera seems to focus faster and takes decent pictures.  Apps load quickly and this phone seems fast. Great phone and great price!"

"on April 19, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Except for NFC good replacement for Nexus 5x,Have owned it for a couple of weeks and really like it. Having enough memory to put all the apps I want is great and adding an SD card for pictures works well. The only missing feature for me is NFC and I can live without Google pay. Works great on the T-Mobile network for me.
"on October 19, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Practical device, great deal","Good android phone. I am glad I made the decision of not ordering pixel 2, this phone is more than adequate if you're someone who just need a phone that can do all the essential 2017 things without the really really fancy stuff."
"on June 5, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm soooo happy! I do not have one complaint,"I didn't want to purchase another expensive phone. Was prepared to spend almost $1K on another iphone. My co-worker told me about these phones, and I read almost all of the 2K reviews. Oh My Gosh! I'm soooo happy! I do not have one complaint. The battery life is unreal; I charge every 3 to 4 days, and I have so many apps on my phone. I think I'll be a loyal fan, from now on."
"on April 8, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect phone for my Mom, compares nicely with my Moto X Pure Edition","Very Impressed.I picked this up to replace a Moto G second edition that I had purchased for my mother.I was a little worried that she might not easily be able to navigate the one touch button in comparison to the soft key button that were at the bottom of her screen on her old phone.I was surprised to see that there was an option to use the phone in either mode by disabling the one touch button in the moto settings app, which essentially shrunk the screen slightly to make room for the old style soft key buttons.When I showed my 71 year old mother the difference between the two options she decided to try navigating with the single button and a few days into using her phone has decided that she likes it better than having the three other soft keys always displayed.I wasn't aware of how the single button worked until setting the phone up. Swiping to the left is back, to the right brings up the recently used apps. Tapping it lightly brings you back to your home screen, while pressing it more firmly turns the display on and off without having to reach for the power button on the side of the phone. It took a little practice, but I was also able to use a lighter long press of the button to bring up Android Assistant.She didn't want to fool around with setting up the fingerprint scanner, so I can't report on that feature.In December of 2016 I gave up the ghost on my original Moto X and picked up a Moto X Pure Edition while they were on sale through a big box store for $249.99.I had the new Moto G5 Plus for a couple of days to set up some screen widgets and get all of my Mother's accounts set up before giving it to her. I have to say that this phone seems just as fast as my MXPE, and has a noticeable increase in battery life.I'm on AT&T; in Central NY and the new Moto G5 plus was able to speedtest faster than my MXPE while connected to a LTE signal.  Side by side and tested at the same time, my MXPE had an LTE download speeed of 42Mbps, while the Moto G5 Plus was faster at 56Mbps.The same advantage didn't happen connected to WiFi at my home. My MXPE will peg my router at 155Mbps while the newer G5 Plus tested at 96Mbps. (Home internet is Fios with an AmpliFi Mesh router setup) For my Mother's usage with her slower Time Warner/Spectrum internet, the G5 Plus is plenty fast enough for her browsing use.Neither of us found the Amazon ad screen an issue when unlocking the phone.I had read in another review that a user was easily able to remove the pre-installed Amazon Android apps, but that wasn't what I found. Like any hard baked in Android app, I did have the option to disable the Amazon apps, but not the ability to uninstall them. My Mom is an Amazon Prime subscriber so I would have ended up installing both the main Amazon app and the instant video app anyway.In comparison to her Moto G second edition, my Mom says that the call quality is better on the G5 Plus, something she didn't realize until using the new phone. She said that her older phone sounded ""tinny"" in comparison.Bottom Line, it was well worth the $60 savings to buy the Amazon version and my Mom not only loves her new phone, but has easily adapted to the one touch button.Be a good son, buy your Mom the Moto G5 Plus.As per the screen shots attached. 3 of the widgets around the Moto clock widget were created by the Power Toggles app, while the Text, Gmail, Facebook, and Voicemail icons with notification counters were created with the Notifyer+ Unread Count app."

"on October 31, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Started out nice enough....but....,"Was a decent phone for first month, then all of a sudden data connection started dropping out, and when trying to make calls it switches from LTE to H and won't connect the call. Dealing with the typical horrible AT&T; customer service is why I bought an unlocked phone. I shouldn't have to go deal with them to get this phone to work imo. I have the newer Nano SIM that's supposed to work fine with this phone.Pros are it's pretty quick (I have 64g/4g model with ads) and the camera is good in solid lighting. Not so good in low light. It's not loaded with bloatware, but almost too stripped down, the default camera app for modifying pics is lame. And, there is also no ability to restart the phone, only shut down completely? That's retarded. When it works it's a decent phone for the money, but their ""fully compatible with AT&T;"" claim is less than accurate in my experience. I would return it if I could and would not buy it again. Might as well of flushed $240 down the toilet.Disliked the default option for taking pictures kept trying to force me to use Amazon cloud backup location instead of the 32g  micro SD as I wanted but I eventually worked that out.Update from few weeks ago when originally reviewed. Still no ability to make calls even after going to AT&T; store twice, they can't figure it out. Phone shows LTE signal and I can text and surf internet fine, but as soon as I attempt to make a call or hit voicemail notification, the phone immediately switches to H and I can't connect to anything, no call of any type works. I've reset network settings, done the APN steps on AT&T; website to no avail. How everything works BUT phone calls on a phone is beyond me. I wish it crapped out when I could have returned it. Their ""fully compatible"" claim is a lie for some of us. I'm happy for those it worked out fine for, but my first Motorola will be my last."

The size is perfect for my hands, not 5.0 but 5.2 and I like the 4GB of RAM so I can load main apps and multitask.  I just realized that they included DUO app.  After playing around with DUO, I didn't realize that I can make video calls between Android and Apple IOS devices!!!  DUO works like a charm over WIFI and people can actually call each other and the video was crisp.  I have yet to test it on a cellular network but I don't think it will be that good but worth a try.  I would check the reviews on DUO because that came out last year but I notice that Google made significant upgrades to DUO product to make it work better as a simple video mechanism.  Half of my family is obsessed with Apple IOS and the other half is obsessed with Google Android.  Is DUO a game changer, not really but it will crush Apple philosophy that no calling to or from videos outside of Apple's own property."

"on April 4, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced my Moto G4 Plus with this phone,"First of all, Thank you Amazon! This phone was shipped to my military overseas address (Germany) the same day it was released and just arrived today.Next, I have 4 of the Moto 4G 64gig in my home, 2 for the kids and the other 2 for me and my wife. I loved the phone until I started experiencing ghost touch on mines after maybe 7 months. Ghost touch would be random, would be on facebook and it would start to touch the like button on random pictures and such.... After no assistant from Moto Amazon agreed to take my phone back. I replaced it with the G5.I ordered the G5 64 without ads and paid the full amount due to my experience with other phones that had ads, I think its worth it to spend the extra $60. I also ordered a clear case and screen protector from SPARIN, all of these orders arrived today. The protector and case fits the phone perfectly.The G5 feels so much more expensive than the G4. Putting both of them aside there is not much of a difference in size but now I'm able to reach with my thumb to the other side of the screen when holding and typing with one hand. I had to get my sim card cut to nano to fit in the tray, I've also put in my SD card. Will do lots of tests in the next few days with camera and all functions I but don't anticipate being down over anything as all should either be like the G4 or improved.The design and feel is nice, the phone came with the micro usb cable, the power brick, a pin for sim tray and some instructions. There were NO Headphones in the box as some videos mentioned. Has a compass sensor. Has no NFC, but I doubt I would ever be using that if it was included.Besides the Ghost Touch issue we've had great experiences with the Moto Plus G4 64, so I feel the G5 will be even better in the long run. Get this phone, no need to spend bunches on more expensive phones."

The low price - you can't beat this deal, and b. 32 gb of memory. I find that, with all the apps I use, 32gb is the minimum if you want any extra data in the form of music, videos, etc. The snapdragon processor is up to any challenge and the battery lasts all day, even with all the extras running in memory.

"on May 20, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Honesty delivered.,Thin plastic is easy to chip and break. This phone was supposed to be a higher quality step up for me. In reality this phone is a 100 dollar cheapo with the extra sensors and upgraded memory.
"on July 11, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,It 100% works with Verizon.,"I almost didn't get this phone because of the negative reviews with Verizon service.  I took it to a CORPORATE Verizon shop, the rep looked up some number on my phone, punched it in his tablet, and gave me the exact SIM card I needed.  Setup took 5 minutes.Despite other reviews, I can confirm the following work perfectly on Verizon:-Mobile hotspot-Visual Voicemail-My Verizon app (I use the widget to display my data)-HD calls, I haven't had an issue with this yet (knock on wood).I got the 64 GB version without ads and replaced a super old Galaxy S5.  Like others have said, there is very little bloatware and almost no lag when using this phone.  Battery life has been surprisingly great.  The fact that it has a fingerprint reader that also acts as a home button, back button, recent apps, is very handy.  I love the Moto gestures to quickly open the flashlight and camera (I didn't think I'd use them, but I do).Cons that I didn't notice from other reviewers prior to my purchase:-The display / colors are very washed out and faded.  While there is a ""vibrant"" color mode, this didn't seem to help.  It noticeably bad at times, but hopefully I'll get used to it or Motorola will create a fix where they give you more control over the color settings (RGB, gamma, contrast, etc).-While the speaker on the G5 is pretty good (better that my S5), the sound quality on the G5 with headphones is awful, just really noticeably bad.  I did a Apples to apples comparison using the same app and headphones vs. my S5.  High quality Mp3s on the G5 sound like you're listening to FM radio, with virtually no bass.  If you frequently listen to music with your phone, avoid this model.All that said, for the speed, battery life, memory card expansion, water resistance, physical home button / fingerprint reader, and most of all the cost, you really can't beat this phone.UPDATE: Thanks to a kind person who added a comment, my music now sounds excellent on the Moto G5.  Yes, out-of-the-box it sounds bad, but I downloaded an Mp3 app called Rocket player, which has a built in equalizer.  After a bit of tuning, music with headphones now sounds great.Other notes.  I wish Moto would provide more flexibility with their ""Moto"" settings app.  For example, the finger printer reader has 3 primary functions.  1) Tap it to use it has home button  2) Medium hold shuts off the screen  3) Long hold opens Google assistant.  I often find myself shutting off the screen by mistake using a medium hold.  Since I can also shut the screen off using the power button, I wish Moto gave an option to disable the Medium hold touch to shut the screen off.Second feature request, there is a hidden white LED built into the speaker.  Rooted devices can control this LED for when charging the phone or to flash when there is a missed call / notification.  I don't want to root my phone, but I encourage Moto to give control to users who may want to use the LED.  The thing that separates Android from Apple is the customization and flexibility.  If Moto created an LED, why not let us use it?  Please consider updating the Moto app to give us control over the LED for missed notifications (flashing light) and charging the phone (solid light).All that said, I still think this is a great phone.  The other day my Uber driver had an S8 mounted to his dashboard and he said the finger printer reader on the back of the phone is a big pain.  I fully agree and love that the G5 has a fingerprint reader and PHYSICAL home buttons on the bottom front.  Virtual home buttons just seem like a waste of screen space and battery to me.  The G5 is a great phone!"
"on April 9, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,ok
"on April 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,iPhone no more!,"I have been an iPhone advocate for 5 Years. Because of Apple's outrageous pricing and limited capabilities, I decided to try this phone. It exceeds the iPhone in every respect. The camera is as good or better than all but the 7s, voice dictation is comparable to Siri, Google assistant is far smarter than Siri, phone conversation recording apps are available and they work (use only when legal), it's a perfect size, phone looks beautiful, lots of expandable storage, the battery last longer than a full day with normal usage, and the price is half that of a comprable iPhone."
"on September 18, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Good Phone at a Great Price,"This phone has been my daily driver for almost 4 months. Before this phone, I was a user of many ""flagship"" Android phones (namely the Samsung Galaxy and Note lines). After getting sick of spending $600+ on a phone, I spent a long time researching the best budget Android phones. I landed on the Moto G5 Plus after reading many, many reviews. Overall, I find this to be a great phone for the price. In reality, it will do just about anything the $600+ phones will do.It will play any game smoothly. It is fast. It is updated to Android 7.0 (Nougat). The battery easily gets me through one full day of moderate usage. It supports Quick Charge 2.0/ Motorola TurboPower to charge quickly.Some things I that I wish this phone had...-An IR blaster (to use the phone as a universal remote)-A LED notification light-Water/ dust protection-Purchasable battery case or removable battery-The premium metal and glass feelOverall, this phone is great for the price, as long as you aren't expecting a flagship device.P.S.I was a bit worried that Amazing advertisements would be a bit annoying, but they are rather unobtrusive. If you do find that they bother you, you can pay $45 to remove them. You go to ""Manage Your Content and Devices"" in Amazon, select your phone, then you will see the option to remove the advertisements."
"on May 18, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Phone - Verizon Wireless Customers Read for Good Info,"The price of this phone cannot be beat.  The Amazon Prime adds are minimally invasive.Seen a lot of complaints about Verizon Wireless .. here is what you need to know:1) Go to a Corporate Verizon Wireless store - not one that has a retailer name in fine print under the giant ""V E R I Z O N "" sign.  The retailers will have a crappy attitude and not do a good job.2)  There is no cost to exchange your sim to get a nano sim to fit the G5.  I was on an old Razor Maxx HD.  Note:  If you go to that retailer they may charge you, just call Verizon and they will credit back what you got charged.3)  The main issue was with Voice calls breaking up .. this is due to a lower carrier signal and having ""Enhanced 4G LTE Mode"" turned on.  If you are in a place with no LTE service or very few bars, then turn OFF Enhanced Mode and everything is good.  The price you pay for this is that you will not be able to use data while talking on a Voice Call.Overall great phone for the price and love that it only has Amazon/Google stuff preloaded .. not all of that other stuff you can't take off.Update on Verizon Experience:Needed to use the phone in Europe.  Called Verizon, my current carrier, as I noticed that the phone was not identified as a Moto G5 Plus on my account and online it would not let me add the best rate for International ($10/day fee that you only pay if you use the phone data/voice service).  After many long conversations with Verizon, bottom line is they told me this phone would not work in Europe.Went to the T-Mobile store,  got a SIM with a new phone number and plan completely worked with the phone in Europe.  They send you a text as soon as you turn it on to spell out terms for where you are at.  You can enable a feature that uses Wifi for telephone calls when you are on WiFi, so that you avoid the only real charge they have (20 cents/minute for voice).  Data worked well.  They do disable HotSpot/Tethering when you are in Europe, but WiFi is pretty much everywhere so was not an issue for my other devices.This phone is great, the only limitations come from the carriers."
"on April 27, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Could've been 5 stars...,"This is a tough review to write at this time.  Let me start by saying I love the features of the phone and how smooth they work.  The fingerprint reader is a major improvement to my Samsung Note 4, and it is nice to not have all the bloatware.  The camera is good for the price of the phone and I love the near stock Android. In fact I love the Moto features on the phone which so far I have noticed are mostly useful gestures that can quickly open the camera and turn on the flashlight.  The screen is good for the price...it is by no means AMOLED comparable but I really don't notice.  The fingerprint button doubling as a multifunction home button is amazing. It makes up for the small-ish screen size because you can reclaim some screen real estate and it really does work well.The features, in combination with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage plus the micro SD card capability sound like a no-brainer for $240 and should all but guarantee a 5 star review. However there are some unforgivable issues I've had within under a month:1.  My data does not work in Mexico using my Verizon plan.  This was never an issue with my Note 4 not with my wife's Pixel. The problem is that Verizon doesn't consider it a ""World Phone"" even though it is fully capable of accessing most cell towers, in the USA and Mexico.  While Verizon is partly to blame, I feel somewhat duped that the phone is advertised as certified as fully compatible with Verizon.  I've heard it all from Verizon from the world phone excuse to them admitting it is simply because I didn't buy the phone from them.2.  Secondly, the much more serious offense.  I had the phone for 2 weeks before it decided to BRICK out of nowhere and for no good reason.  I was looking at my phone waiting for my second morning alarm to go off, when the Moto boot up screen makes a surprise appearance.  The phone then proceeds to shut down and never turn on properly again.  The battery was just about 80% and the phone had been in a Incipio case and had withstood absolutely zero damage of any sort in it's 2 week life.  I was able to get the Fastboot screen and it said the battery status was OK.  But the phone wouldn't boot in regular mode, safe mode, factory reset... nothing.  Luckily, Amazon is awesome and has replaced the defective phone.  However, though I sure hope.the chances of getting 2 defective phones are slim, I will be living in rear of a random bricking after my return period is up.  This results in a permanent one star loss that Motorola/Lenovo won't get back.Obviously I feel the phone is worth the value and the risk at the price of $240. To get another phone that would equally satisfy my feature AND current carrier needs I'd be spending more like $650.  Albeit the phone doesn't work 100% properly with Verizon.TLDR: A solid 5 star value performance from the phone minus 1 star for Moto/Lenovo quality control (received defective phone initially) and minus 1 star for limited Verizon compatibility (data doesn't work in Mexico as it should with my plan)."
"on September 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,A NO BRAINER !!!!,"Gotta say, after a week this phone has lived up to everything I expected. Flawlessly fast, no lag whatsoever, and the reception is exceptional both Wi-Fi and lte.  I couldn't tell you how many reviews I read and watched on you tube before buying this and so far it is the best phone I have ever bought. All the hype I've read seems to be true. Turbo charge is awesome. If I have a gripe it would be the camera. Not too premium. Especially at night. Since I am no Martin Scorsese I do not care. Some might.. Do not buy this phone for the camera. Buy this phone for the fluid interaction with a pure android experience. Get the 4 gig rom version. You will not be disappointed. Watching movies on this baby is a pure joy. I usually use my fire hd but this has proven to be just as vivid and smooth as silk. I am no tech geek but I am fastly learning the differences in a quasi budget phone and a quasi flagship phone. This is the latter. You get a lot of bang for your buck here .Just be sure to get a NANO sim (not micro) if you want to use it right away for calls.. Set-up was a breeze as well. In fact I have gotten several updates in the week I have had this phone. If there are any problems I will update this review but until then  HELLO MOTO!!!.UPDATE:  ! month later.......So I kept expecting SOMETHING to go wrong because I'm a Scorpio and a cynic. Guess what? Even more happier with this purchase than ever. Have tried to take advantage of the amenities that moto and nougat have to offer and slowly but surely am figuring them out. Phone camera also. The Wi-Fi and phone reception are outstanding. Voices are clear on phone and Bluetooth. I am O.K. with the sound also. I read someone shade on the proximity locator (compass) navigator thingamajig, but the phone I got knows where I am to the square meter or so. A lil scary in fact. Phone works seamlessly with Echo(Alexa) and Hue and Fire stick apps. I can't tell you how wonderful this phone has treated me. So I am trying to treat it with respect as well. Get a screen protector and case. Even Gorillas have to scratch sometime."
"on April 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Phone, Good Price","I'm coming from a Moto G 2nd gen. That phone was sluggish and frustrating to use. I have the Standard 64GB/8MB Ram version.General comments would be that I don't care about the quality of the camera as long as it takes decent pictures so that had no bearing on the decision to buy this phone. I also don't care about a ""premium"" feel. I want the screen to be good but I'm never going to be watching 4K movies on the phone. All I want is a quick phone that is not going to give me problems and not going to cost me $700.Pro's- Extremely fast, everything loads instantly.- Reliable, nothing has crashed or shown any signs of bugs yet.- Plenty of internal storage, my old Moto G2 was sluggish partly because the internal storage was almost full and there was barely enough room to install key apps.- Fingerprint reader to unlock phone is really quick and easy.- Price - Easily justifies itself against a ""premium"" flagship phone.- Battery - Really good consumption. I've actually had to NOT charge my phone every other night so that i'm not continually charging the phone at 70%-80% - I'd like to fully deplete the battery a few times. I could get 2-3 days out of the phone with light-medium usage.- Radio/Signal - I don't know if this is down to the LTE or generally the technology in newer phones but all my/my families phones hit dead spots in all the same places in my surrounding area. This phone not only doesn't suffer from these dead spots but it has GOOD signal in these areas. I have never had any signal in my office building for example but now i have at least 50% signal.- Screen - Extremely clear. Good resolution if you're viewing VR in Cardboard.Con's- I don't see the point of the metal back plate. I don't care about materials or a ""premium feel"" at all and I put a case on the phone anyway. All the metal does is unbalance the phone and give a weight bias towards the rear of the phone. I feel like it's falling backwards out of my hand sometimes but it's something I will get used to.- Not waterproof. This was the only key desires for a new phone that I gave up.- Size - This is very minor but the screen is a little too big for one-handed use, my thumb can't stretch across the screen without significant hand adjustments. There is a Moto gesture that shrinks the screen for one-handed use but I found that less convenient than not using it. The shrunken screen is too small to be useable.- No NFC - I have never been able to use this feature before because none of my previous phones have it so i don't actually know what i'm missing. Still, i'd like what appear to be standard features included on the phone. Not a big deal for me personally but if the technology advances a lot in the next couple of years i would like to have it.- Moto/Notifications - There is no notification light and the Moto notification display doesn't provide great customization. It will blink for a new notification but not continue to blink if you missed it. You can nudge the phone to have it blink but you can't glance at it from across the room and see if there is something waiting for you. These seem like some basic options that should be available."
"on April 17, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,I like the phone but I can't believe it takes 2+ ...,I am still unable to use LTE data via AT&T.;  Reset the APN and did FDR also.  I have been to the local AT&T; store and spent about an hour on the phone with AT&T; tech support twice and still no LTE data.  I like the phone but I can't believe it takes 2+ weeks to get this widespread of an issue resolved.  Success in resolving it seems to depend on which AT&T; tech support person you are able to reach.  I can manually add an APN and get HSDPA or use a working SIM from another device (my wife's phone) and get LTE data.  If I can't get it working in the next few days I'm going to return it.  Other than not getting LTE I really like the phone.
"on July 11, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says.,"Bought this out of frustration with my last 2 Samsung S phones.  Although it doesn't have the bells and whistles the Samsungs had, it also doesn't have the problems and it just works!  I miss the inductive charging, but the turbo charge really makes up.  Battery life is good enough that I've never had to charge during the day, unlike my previous phones..."
"on July 16, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon reviews deceiving - poor call quality makes this NOT the phone to buy,"All these Amazon reviews look great! Unfortunately, the phone has a MAJOR flaw - it has horrible sound/ call quality!!I have found there is more than one issue leading to bad sound quality. There is documentation that this is a common problem - do a google search on ""moto g5 speaker low volume"".And it looks like Motorola/ Lenovo is not responding to the issue....I had the phone for all of one day - spent the day setting the whole thing up, then put in my SIM card and called my voicemail for a test. And... soft. too soft to hear well (at top volume setting)!! put the SIM back into my old phone, and no issue (at 70% volume).I went through and tried everything on the Lenovo website - including, finally factory reset (which I really hated to do, considering the time I put into setting up the phone!).  But it did not completely solve the problems.So, things I have learned about the issue (at least with my phone and with AT&T;) - 1) there is a conflict between the dialer/calling program and another COMMON program (since there are so many people with the issue). the speaker volume is BETTER (but still not great) with either hangout dialer (voIP was better than AT&T; through the moto dialer program) or after factory reset (without adding any 3rd party program). However, it is still not great (and the volume is still not to the level of my old phone).The other thing I discovered, playing around with it, is that the trajectory of the sound from the earpiece is not directly perpendicular. It seems to be louder at a top of the phone diagonal. AND the microphone quality is not great. What this suggests (to me anyway) is that the phone is not properly lined up with the components. This could be the particular phone I received, or a design flaw (or it is me just guessing about the engineering).I called Amazon to see if this issue was previously reported, and they said I was the only one??! Hmmm... is no other Amazon customer reporting issues with the call quality to Amazon?  After doing a brief search now, only a couple reviews mention it, and surely not as severely as the issue is!! Originally they were going to send a replacement, but after finding that so many others reporting the issue, I've decided to cancel the replacement and go with a different phone.I'm very disappointed in Lenovo/ Motorola! While people use phones for so many things these days, most people still need to talk on their phone! they should also acknowledge and correct the issue!!"
"on April 2, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Initial Thoughts -- Somewhat Disappointed,"Received the phone Friday afternoon. Here are my initial impressions- excellent delivery time, although the outer box was opened on one end like someone was trying to look inside- works on cricket wireless with no problems- only a couple of of those annoying worthless apps that you can't delete or force stop- have had issues with the phone freezing and/or unable to unlock the screen (have to restart to gain access)- laggy sometimes.  it does not always recognize my finger swipes and when it does there is significant delay of 4-5 seconds- have not charged phone since Friday evening and it is at 42% on Sunday lunchtime- much better than my old phone, but somewhat disappointed"
"on May 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Moto X Pure Edition was great, but had issues with bluetooth and picture messages","What an incredible value!  After having a string of reliable phones, I've bounced between a few in the last year-plus.  My Moto X Pure Edition was great, but had issues with bluetooth and picture messages, and the Nexus 5X that followed had a charging port that failed twice.So, based on the positive reputation of the G series and the strong early reviews, I decided to take a chance on the G5+.Performance seemed a little bumpy at first, but as the phone got things cached it became astoundingly fast, especially at this price point.  I'm sure having 4GB of RAM has something to do with that, and it was definitely worth the extra money.  By that same token, the 64GB internal storage is very impressive for a phone at this price point, especially when it also supports SD cards.Oh, and a note on battery life - It's incredible.  I work in a profession that prevents me from using my phone much, but even if I have 1-2 hours screen time I still end the day (16 hours off charge) with 70% or more.  If I'm working long hours, I'm convinced I could get 4 days out of this thing.  Left off the charger overnight for 8 hours, it only loses 2-3% charge.  On non-work days, when I'm on it a lot more, I've only barely managed to put it below 50%.  Truly worry-free, and the included Turbo Power charger works as advertised.The fingerprint sensor is very good as well.  It's on the bottom bezel of the phone, which isn't necessarily ideal - I loved the sensor on the back of the Nexus 5X - but it's fast, works as an on-off switch, and can be used to replace on-screen controls - swipe left to go back, swipe right to show recent apps, and tap to go to the home screen.  Long press to lock.  I played with this a bit, and it seems to work reliably as intended.Honestly, the worst features are the slightly-slick metal body and the new moto logo on the upper bezel, which looks silly.  Motorola has built a reputation of making phones unadorned with branding of any sort, short of their logo on the back, and this bit just reminds me of ugly Verizon Droid brandings of the past.I long for the curved backs of the X series, but it's a minor complaint.  If you need a phone that is quick and responsive, has a great-looking screen, runs Android 7.0, you could break the bank.  Or, you could buy the Moto G5+ for $299."
"on July 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Can you tell I am super excited about this phone?,"I'm glad I didn't listen to the naysayers. Look I understand if you have Verizon or whatever that causes difficulties, but fortunately I have T-Mobile which works perfectly with this phone. This phone is incredible all the way around the clock. I have been using a BLU Studio C for a couple of years and really liked it even though I could not get a signal in the house and had to go outside, or lean the phone up against a window in order to get text messages. It only had 8 Gigs of storage space so I was always running in less than one gig of that no matter how many programs/apps I deleted, and moved over to the SD card so consequently I couldn't do an update by clicking on ""Update All"" when it suggested it because there was no place to store the new versions of the apps while they were all downloading. So I had to manually install one at a time. Then there is the screen it is not 1080 on the BLU phone so it was kind of dull. Okay, okay I could go on, but this is a review on the Moto G Plus 5th generation. Only by realizing what I was putting up with can you fully appreciate my reaction to getting the Moto.So here goes. This phone is unbelievable. Not only does it have 64 Gigs of internal memory, I also added a 64 Gig SD card. Now when I click on storage in settings, even with the operating system and a bunch of apps it says I have 113 GIGS of memory available. That's a far cry from 800 Megs. So I loaded it up with all of the things I want to do.The screen clarity is fabulous. I like bright screens and the default is less than full brightness I guess to save battery life, but I torqued it up full. What a fabulous picture. Now onto the video and picture taking capability. I notice people complaining about taking photos or videos in low light. I must admit my brothers Samsung Galaxy S7 which was an $800 phone does take phenomenal photos in low light, yes better than the Moto. So if you want to spend an extra $500 you can have great low light photography too. What I really wanted to comment on is that most cameras that are full blown expensive cameras struggle in low light, This Moto takes fabulous 4k videos, and photos in medium and bright light. I was shocked at how good they were, and how great they looked on this high def. screen.Now onto the sound. It sounds GREAT. It is plenty loud and clear, and the microphone sounds great to the person on the other end of the line. When I read the reviews that they could barely hear the messages they must have gotten a defective phone or something. Expecting the least, and willing to absorb it due to the low cost I was blown away when I first heard a spoken voice coming from the phone, and music sounds wonderful too.Now here is a real biggie. As I mentioned I was getting zero signal inside of my house on the BLU Studio C but on this phone I can be in the house, in a closet and still get a signal; it never fails. I am getting 3 and 4 bars inside whereas before I was getting zip, Nada on my BLU rendering the phone useless unless I was outside.I did have to go to the local T Mobile store and get a new SIM card because the one in the Blu Studio C was larger than the one this phone took. Fortunately they sell one SIM that fits all phones; they come with breakouts reducing the size to whatever yours is. The guy in the store said all SD cards are the same size, and he was right, at least the one that I had in my Blu Studio C dropped right in.I run my entire house through Amazon Alexa and various other apps. Now I can actually do that all in one place thanks to the space and functionality. No more having to find which device I had which app stored in. This is my new control center.I got the battleship gray because it was the Prime Day special, but I figured I could get a good case/cover for it in whatever color most appealed to me. I actually found a real leather one that doubles as a stand.So my phone is my new toy after having one for years. It opens up a new world having this much capacity. And oh yeah, this thing is a performance monster. With the 2.0 octacore processor everything works like a snap. My old phone was a 1.3. The full 4 Gig or ram helps greatly also.This is the number one selling phone currently on Amazon quite simply because it gives you the most bang for the buck. You may not be getting wireless charging but my brother has that in his Samsung and has the charger but never uses it because it takes forever to charge the phone. You can read the specs this thing charges in a flash.So if you want a monster of a good performer and don't care about dropping 5 more big ones for some extra bells and whistles, this is the phone to get. Can you tell I am super excited about this phone?PS: After reading some of the negative reviews even though they were not anywhere near the number of 4 and 5 stars I was hesitant to buy it. So I figured if something wasn't to my liking I can return it within 30 days for a refund. Guess what? I put it under my pillow at night. This thing runs a very, very close second to Alexa. :-)"
"on April 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the upgrade for sure.,"Tons of space, sharp crystal clear screen, amazing design that feels like a high-end device, and the super awesome swipe feature on the thumb reader make this phone absolutely worth buying. This is coming from the Moto G4 Plus to the G5 Plus."
"on November 24, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best of the mid-range phones, a King has come!","Bought on another e-tailer site on a Black Friday deal. This is the second one I've bought, previous was purchased from a big blue box retailer. I migrated from a Samusung Galaxy S5 on the Verizon network.Pros:You're not going to get a better performer at this price point. Long battery life, snappy performance, stock android (no bloatware), and service unlocked (works well on Verizon). 64gb storage to avoid ""forced obsolescence"", 4gb RAM, and an EXCELLENT fingerprint reader, better than the S5 even!. Love the ""Moto Actions"" app that allows the home / fingerprint reader button to act as a ""back"" and ""active apps"" button as well, giving more room on screen for apps by eliminating those from the display. Most Verizon apps still work (Message+, Visual Voicemail), except ""My Verizon"". It works, it just doesn't remember your password like it should, no big deal as you just have to keep entering your password to get your billing/account information (surprisingly, it still accurately shows the data ""odometer"" though). Why would anyone pay $1,000 for a smartphone when I can easily surf the net and make calls just as quick, for less than 1/4 the price. Very few users will EVER use a $1,000 phone to it's full potential. But what exactly is full potential??? We're not launching rockets here. I look down on Apple users that are running ""bleeding edge"" hardware. Then again, I thank those ""first adopters"", they're helping pave the way for more ""cost conservative"" options for the other 98% of us smartphone users.Cons:Very very ""slick"", it demands a case of some sort, otherwise, it's gonna slip right out of your hands. Some features not as smooth as Samsung TouchWiz UI. I installed Nova Launcher right out of the box to bring back some of that Samsung ""slickness"". I also didn't like that you didn't get the little red number notifications (officially, ""unread count badges"") on the app icons, so I installed TeslaUnread for Nova Launcher to get that back. I also don't like my notification volume tied to my ringtone volume, a limitation in Android Nougat apparently, and there is NO current workaround except for root maybe (I say ""maybe"" because I'm not willing to root currently, so I haven't looked into it). Native Camera app sucked, used a 3rd party app instead (be sure to deactivate native camera app before installing 3rd party app, otherwise you may suffer a reported glitch. As of this writing (11/24/2017), there's a Facebook crash bug / glitch being reported by many users including myself, although there are some ""workarounds"" that help reduce crashes. Hopefully there will be a fix from either Motorola or Facebook soon (not a deal breaker, but annoying as the app crashes quite randomly).Overall:My Samsung Galaxy S5 was hogtied at just 16gb of storage and then I did all I could do to ""limp it along""...move apps to SD card, adoptive storage, etc. Those tweaks started making that phone quite wonky and it was time to move on. This phone is as responsive as the S5, if not more so, especially once the S5 got to it's maximum storage capacity. Migrating to this phone was only slightly painful as there are several things I liked on the S5 (some sounds even!). There are a few easy ""tweaks"" (Nova Launcher, TeslasUnread, etc) you can do to this phone to get it darn near close to that Samsung TouchWiz UI slickness. I even managed to find and download some Samsung specific notification and alarm sounds that I truly like!! (Don't hate me for the ""whistle text notification"" ;-) Yeah, it's not quite there, but at this price point, I laugh in the face of other ""wireless provider coddled"" phone buyers. You know, the ones that pay upwards of $600, or more, plus tax in most states, over the course of ""interest free"" 24 months just to get a phone that is ""network proper"". I took off one star, which is slightly being nit picky, for the need to tweak this to the ""Samsung experience"", crappy camera app, and the current Facebook glitch. In it's own right, it's a great phone, but if you've come from Samsung you'll be slightly disappointed unless you're willing to tweak the UI as I did. If I could, I would give 4.5 stars."
"on June 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a high-end model of Hyundai Sonata, so don't think you are buying a Mercedes","I purchased it recently and been using it last few days. I have used iPhone 6, Galaxy S6, LG G4, Note 4 etc., in last few years. I bought 32GB, Amazon Ad versionBiggest problem with negative reviews is that people compare Peanuts with Doughnuts. It isn't a $600 plus high-end phone, so ignore all the complaints that it isn't as good as S7 or S8, or iPhone 7. It is a sub $200 budget phone, like a loaded version of Hyundai Sonata, not Lexus or Mercedes. Once you realize that fact, this phone will amaze you.Pros: Battery life is phenomenal, finger print reader and its one button navigation is my favorite, HD screen is really good, Camera is excellent for most (80%) shooting situations with good-moderate light and relatively steady objects, Video is also good enough for everyday use. Processed speed and multiple applications are not a problem, unless you play intensive HD games while opening 10 other apps.Cons: Low light performance is a problem, but passable with flash. No optical image stabilization so you can't take fast moving objects. It can't take good pictures of your Formula 1 or Indy races, but expecting these things in a $200 smart phone requires you to visit a psychiatrist. Carry a DSLR or a good pocket megazoom if you really want top notch photos or spend $700 and get an iPhone or S8.Call quality is great, battery can last for 2 days with moderate use, turbo charging, fast and responsive processor.I needed a responsive, good quality camera smart phone and this one servers the purpose 100%."
"on September 17, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class for any kind of Value/Performance assessment,"I manage 400 wireless lines and deal with hundreds of wireless devices a year. I don't care to have a company phone, so I am a BYOD person. I got my first cellphone in 1994, my first smartphone in 2007. I've had my 5Gen for 2.5 months now (replacing a G Plus G4). I have some strong opinions regarding phones, informed by supporting many hundreds of users over that time period.Up to now, the two best phones I recall using have been the Oki 1325 and the HTC 6700/Cingular. The former was such a good analog phone, people would argue with me when I told them I was in my truck - they honestly believed I was in my office. The latter was a Windows CE device with a fantastic handsfree capability when coupled with a Plantronics PLT 510 and Microsoft Voice - that combo was money. I stretched it out to almost five years before the 1xRTT became unbearable.Android or Apple, having paid cash for cellphones for a long time, I never felt I was getting value for money. The WORST phone I ever had was the only ""free"" phone I ever settled for, a Motorola RAZR of some flavor that was junk. I swapped it at a Cingular store for $500 to get that HTC device, which was excellent (still miss physical keyboards).I was horrified when Motorola was sold to Lenovo, and I couldn't have been more wrong. The G Plus 5G is almost an archetype of what a decent smartphone should be. I was pretty happy with my 4G but the screen was just that little bit too big to manage one handed, and I have large hands. The 5G is freakin' perfect.The Nokia and Motorola convention of a side mounted power/activation button is obviously correct, and still not fixed on Apple's SE series. I find it amusing that being ""different"" in this case constituted being ""wrong"" until you get to the iPhone 6 and up series. Again, running a phone one handed is normal, and Motorola knows that already.Great fingerprint sensor, responsive UI, extensible storage, great screen and good/sensible resolution, the gestures work perfectly and I use them all the time, very compatible for taking to my own cellphone provider.I've been battery paranoid since I was a kid, it hurt me when the AA's in my remote control Lamborghini Countach (it was black) ran out, and the 9v in the controller wasn't far behind. I bought an extra Duracell laptop battery for my 1994 Compaq Contura Aero because I remembered what a drag it was when my NEC MultiSpeed went bye-bye from an exhausted battery. I have multiple smart charging blocks scattered around my house. I am slowly adjusting to the reality that my Moto G Plus will in fact go TWO DAYS on a single charge with my normal use patterns (>100 emails, 5 phone calls, 20 texts per day). Hard to wrap my head around, but I'm getting there.Accessories are plentiful and reasonably priced, but my preferred case vendor UAG did a solid job making case TOO unwieldy for my use. I'm not a pants pocket phone person, my pants pocket has something else in it, so a shirt pocket compatible case is a requirement. I used NO case for my G4 and that worked out fine, but I was able to find a slim case for my G5 with minimal hassle. More than good enough, and I use the UAG MilSpec case when I go four wheeling. UAG's on Surface Pro 3's, Surface 3's, iPad Mini, yep yep and more yep - they are the bomb.The only negative is delays to updating the core Android OS - I'm not feeling STUCK on 7.0, but dammit, this is stock as stock can get, gimme the new stuff!I'm thinking about buying another one as a spare. Seriously."
"on July 29, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,"I decided to give this a go as a budget Android phone.  Our family is solidly in the iOS camp, but I had been curious about what Android had to offer.  I brought this phone and got it hooked up through Verizon without any issues - I was in and out of the Verizon store in about 10 minutes (we already had a Verizon account with other devices on it).In general, the phone is just fine.  Battery life is great, and performance is fine.  It's not as snappy as an iPhone 6s or 7 - scrolling in web pages, and games like Pokmon Go just take longer to load and stutter a bit more.  But it gets the job done.  I'm not a fan of the power switch being BELOW the volume rocker - the phone is relatively large, and when holding it, your thumb fairly naturally rests on the power switch, which isn't all that useful.  The fingerprint reader works well, and the Motorola app allows programming of the reader to do a 'back' and 'home' command, freeing up some screen space, which is cool.  I turned off the long-press on the fingerprint reader to turn off the device, because it was far to easy to turn the phone off - the 'long press' must be like a second - I found myself accidentally turning the phone off far too often.Anyhoo, the biggest gripe I have by far with the phone isn't actually the phones fault - it's Android.  Out of the box with Android 7, there's no way to tell if you have unread e-mails - the apps don't have 'badges'.  Coming from iOS, this is hugely annoying.  I know in some cases this can be restored with a change of launder and a bunch of configuration, but it's a crappy annoyance to deal with.  Supposedly this might be fixed in the new version of Android.So, overall - it's a nice phone.  Not the fastest in the world, but it doesn't well enough for normal use.  Good battery life, good build quality, nice screen, and all of the pro's and con's of Android.Once last comment - I don't find the Amazon stuff too intrusive.  By default there is a widget set up to show Amazon sales, but it is easily removed like any other widget.  Once you do that, the only real Amazon thing that is forced on you is an add on the unlock screen - not a biggie."
"on September 11, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good first impression,"First impressions. More to follow after I have used it some.Caveat: Notice that there is a SIM card access key in a tiny easy to miss envelope in the box.Just got this to run on Mint (a budget GSM MVNO) as my other phone was a locked Tracfone (with an integral SIM) and their coverage has become very spotty in areas where before it was fine (I travel a lot: TX-NC-VA-NY-IN-KS-CO so need decent national coverage.).No removable battery so cannot rip it out to rapidly kill phone when those rare occasions occur; tho, there are features (motion and fingering) to help with a quick silencing.Glad I got the protective elastomer case as phone case material could not be more slippery were it greased. Thin, nice heft, and feels good in the hand with the protective elastomer case. Brilliant high def screen. Motorola has done well with many handy features. Got the cheaper Amazon version with their lock screen ad and a plethora of their apps which has not proven to be a cost saving albatross; thus, worth the $35 savings.Has a ""finger"" print  sensor lock/unlock feature that works well.  Notice the quotes around finger are there because a thumb print works, too.Working well as a mini-tablet.More on actual use after I get the SIM and use the phone for a while. OK, got the SIM. This is the first time I have done this and it was not intuitive in the least! Firstly, I was amazed at how hard I had to push the key into the SIM card access hole to get the card holder to ""pop"" out! Secondly, there are no decent instructions showing where to put and how to orient the SIM card. This is how I did it: 1- power off the phone, 2- release the SIM card holder by firmly pushing the key into the hole in the holder thus causing the ejection trigger to push the holder up out of tbe case, 3- after releasing the holder with the key, hold the phone as though you were going to look at the screen with the SIM port on the top edge of the phone case, 4- as you slide the SIM card holder out the SIM card lays on top of the holder immediately inside it with the card notch on the lower right hand side and the SIM circuit board surface facing up, 5- push the SIM card holder back into the phone case until it latches, 6- power on the phone, 7- follow the SIM card provider instructions for activating the phone. Phone usage comments after a short period of local usage to follow."
"on July 16, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent phone,"This phone is fast, powerful, and the battery is a significant upgrade.  I owned the lg g3 at launch, so my comparison will be to that phone.  Generally I use my phone for playing music over bluetooth (whenever I'm not asleep), browsing the web, and occasionally watching videos or playing games.  Through average usage, I got about 4 days of battery life.  On my G3 I was barely getting one-two days.  When looking at the specs, this phone has  a smaller and lower-resolution screen than my g3.  Honestly, I don't notice it at all; however the bezels are large.  Luckily the phone allows you to bind the fingerprint scanner at the bottom to the navigation buttons.  This frees up the whole screen of the phone.  The G3 is about as fast as a phone needs to be, and this phone is faster than it.  I've seen video comparisons, and this phone is maybe milliseconds in speed differences with the leading flag-ship phones of 2017.  Not only is it fast, it stays cool even with all the apps that I generally use.  I'd also like to mention that the back is metal, the sides are plastic, and the top bezel is fake chrome.  The camera falls short of expectations in low-light photos, which means that there's definite noise.  It also protrudes out of the phone, so cases are a must-have.  This version also has Amazon ads, but they do not hinder my experience one bit.  The ram on this phone is 1GB more than my G3, and I recommend having at least 3GB of ram even for general use. Most web applications can potentially close background apps even if you have 3GB of ram.  I believe that the speakers are average, and they are on the front.  The volume rocker and power button are on the side, which is normal, but I prefer the g3's ""buttons on the back design"".  The buttons are plastic, and the power button is textured so you can tell it apart.  The fingerprint scanner is durable and can withstand even knife scratches.If I were to compare this to the modern flagship phones, I'd say that you're not missing a whole lot on the specifications side of things. The  camera does have issues in low-light scenarios and speaker quality isn't the greatest.  While this phone is extremely durable, the physical build does use plastic in a few areas.  It also lacks water resistance, but it'll survive a splash or two if you're careful.  Overall, if you can get this phone for less than 200$, you'll have no regrets.A word of warning to those who plan to purchase the ad-version:  You cannot root this phone.  There is no expected root method for the ad-version within the next two years.  You should also expect very few updates for the ad-version.  That being said (as a rooted lg g3 owner), the resources provided by root are not necessary for every android user.Update - 1000 hours (powered on) into the phone, 9/2/2017So I've had this phone for awhile now.  It feels like a flagship phone, even though it's not.  I really like the shake to turn on the flashlight, and the twist to turn on the camera gestures.  I still get great battery life out of it, and the speeds are excellent.  Honestly, I feel that this phone should cost 300$ or more.  Regarding the ads, they are no more annoying than lock screen  I see them when I turn the screen on, and a swipe later, they're gone.  I'm not missing root at all, but for longevity purposes, the lack of such a feature could still be considered a drawback.  There isn't much I have against this phone, besides the issue below.The one actual issue I have with it is that the call-volume is extremely low.  The speaker can be loud during media playback, and during calls, it's kind of soft and not very effective in populated areas.  There doesn't seem to be any settings fix for this either.  It's not a hardware issue, so I hope that it is fixed in the future."
"on July 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for me.,"The reviews were right. Best bang for your buck. I've been using an iPhone 6 for the past 2 1/2 years and a 5 for 2 years before that. Android has come a long way since then. There is a learning curve switching back but it's not too bad. This phone has great features. The fingerprint pad works great. As a cabinetmaker, my fingers are trashed, I could not really use the one on the iPhone. I like the way you can twist the phone to bring up the camera. Also the way you can bring up the flashlight. These are useful to me. I'm sure I will continue to enjoy this phone. People started telling me that they couldn't hear me well with the iPhone 6. I had the same problem with the 5 and I spent money to have it fixed. No one could fix it. I wasn't going to do that again with the 6. That's why I bought the Moto. 16 gig 6 unexpandable--32 gig Moto with SD slot. No sacrifice here!"
"on September 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of awesome... :),"Okay, before Samsung Galaxy came on the market, and back when cells were essentially new (and s. l. o. w.), the size of Rhode Island, and the weight of same, I used to regularly use Motorola for all my cell needs.  They eventually fell faaaaaaaaar behind, I stepped away, and never looked back.  Was a Samsung nerd from that point onwards.  Today however, I am older, and disabled, and though I still had a Samsung Galaxy s5 (you can see how long I valued my phones, the s9 was out at that point and I was still on my s5!), it was in the process of finally breaking down.  As I knew I would be VERY poor shortly, I went shopping for both a carrier, and a REALLY cheap cell.  Wandered across this new, in the box, Moto (aka Motorola) along with its unlocked status, and though partnered with Amazon, its SUPER low price.  My previous phone had cost me $700 or so new.  This one?  Unlocked and partnered with Amazon?  $239.99 (w/64 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads).  You could also buy it without Amazon advertising (for $299.00), but I thought about it for a bit, and thought, ""When have I ever been harassed or bothered by Amazon ad's?"" -- Besides which as another review showed, you could always put the single phone ON ad aside onto another page, and never see it again.  So today I see only the occasional ads on the locked screen (when you view it, you can still see all the information you want shown, alternate phone number, etc.), but have more or less trained myself not to register the ads.  I tend to not be a spree buyer from Amazon any longer, as my income was reduced to a tenth of what it had been, and I am disabled.  PERFECT phone for those looking for inexpensive, and not annoying as the dickens when it comes to advertising. :)"
"on April 18, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Can you speak up please?!,"I sold my Moto G4 and got this Moto G5 plus. I like this Moto G plus better off course. The G4's 5.5 inch screen was just too big for my hands. I like to be able to type with one hand. The fingerprint scanner is great as it's also for turning pages. Speed wise it seems about the same be as the G4... For reason the speaker, whether on speakerphone or just regular to my ear is low. I walk with it to my ear and try to put the volume up but it's all the way up. If you had the other Moto G's it has this warning when you wanted to raise the volume above a certain level saying it can be bad for your ears but then you could still raise it. Now it seems like the loudest the volume gets is at the level that the warning would show at. It also only has one SIM card holder which sucks because I travel between London and Los Angeles. So it's better than the G4 but lacks dual SIM and the G4'S speaker was louder. Other than the single SIM and low volume is great and I'd recommend it. The low sound level is a problem for me tho and I want to see if it's just my phone personally or the whole line of G5 plus. If it's just my phone let me know please so I can exchange it for another, cuz I can't raise the volume."
"on June 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Unlocked Phone at an Incredible Price,Tired of buying flagship phones and then after two years they start to fail or slow down. I had an LG G3 which I liked but WiFi died making the phone  useless after 2 years. Needed a quick replacement and so far this has been great for the money. Activated fine. I just needed to get a smaller sim and it activated right away with no issues. I would prefer a larger screen but this gives me the freedom to move to any carrier which is awesome. Rep at the ATT store was pretty impressed by the phone. 5  payments instead of 24 payments and freedom to move to any carrier. You can't go wrong.I use the phone all day for business and it meets all my needs. I dont really need to spend another $600 for a fancier model that does the same thing. Camera is better than my LG3 but probably not as great as a Pixel but its not worth the difference to me. If you need a VERY GOOD phone for a great price this is it. I bought the 2gb with ads and the ads do not bother me at all.
"on April 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good phone for $240. Would recommend.,"The previous phone I owned before this is the original Moto G that I bought about 2.5 years ago. It's still working, albeit battery life has gone down, kept the screen wrap as a screen cover, and it lags when pulling out apps by about half a second to a second. Still tolerable for me, but the main issue is that I've reached the 16 GB internal memory limit after many application updates. Found this offer and bought the phone and received it 3-4 days ago.Here are things I'm happy about.- 64/4 GB compared to Moto G's 16/1 GB- Improved chipset compared to Moto G with a better CPU and GPU, albeit not the top of the line, but good enough for my purposes.- Includes additional SD Card slot while Moto G had none- Can be used with Republic Wireless carrier, which I used on my Moto G.- Flexibility to switch to 3-4 other major carriers if I deem one carrier's plan to suddenly be better than my current one.- Charging is decently quick and battery life lasted me a good day or two before a need to recharge- It's $240. I could literally grab 2.5 of these for a single iPhone 7 or Google Pixel. 3 if you consider the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel XL. The only other phone I've seriously considered in my smartphone hunt is the OnePlus 3T given its specs for only in $400 range, but they have very limited carriers, unfortunately.And here are things I'm sad about:- Still no replaceable battery. I honestly thought 5G Plus could follow 5G with a replaceable battery, but that's not the case. However, this is being a trend in the smartphone market, so it's a normal thing.- Not a dual SIM phone. Apparently, US market seems to think dual SIMs shouldn't be a thing. So again, it's a normal thing.... in the US market.- No LED flash notification for notices. This can be somewhat alleviated by leaving notification sounds to be on a decently good level for sound, but still something that I think they should have kept.- It's a bigger phone with a 5.2 in screen and I find it harder to fit in my hand compared to Moto G. An extra 0.7 in makes a big differenceAnd here are things that I've considered, but do not really care about:- Better camera specs than Moto G. However, I rarely use my phone to take pictures, so this is irrelevant. Just a nice bonus to the side.- No NFC. I've never been able to use NFC for things like Android Pay so I'll miss out on what it does. At the same time, I couldn't care less since I still bring my wallet around with me.- Amazon ads. I've already had apps like Slidejoy on Moto G, so this kind of thing doesn't bug me.- Looks ok. I could care less about the premium looks they're trying to sell. I just need one that performs well and is still decently flat enough to fit in a pocket- Concerns about software updates. It's Lenovo that now takes care of software updates for this phone and Lenovo's reputation for updates is pretty low. I'm perfectly fine with the stock 7.0 Nougat software even if there won't be an upgrade for the next couple years. Heck, I've used Jellybean/Lollipop for over 2 years and it doesn't bug me.Overall, very satisfying phone so far over a few days. Would recommend it if you want to enter the smartphone industry or want to upgrade from an old phone like Moto G."
"on May 4, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phone, but be persistent","After using Samsung phones for the last 6 years, I switched my husband to this model. Others have already stated how well this phone works, and I concur. Just be prepared: I had to jump through hoops to get this activated on Verizon. After trying to activate the phone online, I had to order a SIM from them (this phone requires a ""nano"" SIM). After receiving it today, I went back online to my account to activate it. The system told me the SIM was not compatible (uh, I got it from YOUR company!) So I called Customer Service. The rep was very nice, went through the process of entering everything on his end, then told me the phone was not compatible with their system and that I would have to buy a Verizon phone. After speaking with his supervisor, the phone was activated with no further problems. Moral of the story: nicely ask for a supervisor!"
"on August 10, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, especially for the price!","Used to have a LG G3, phone would die in hours, take longer to charge, slower processor, more expensive, and had less features. This is definitely an upgrade!Super speedy processor, tons of memory and storage space. And with the amazon prime exclusive discount how can you argue on the price. Don't waste your money on the standard version, I have noticed no issues or intrusions with the amazon ads, if you install the amazon app anyway you would get the same thing on your lock screen / notifications bar and wouldn't have gotten a discount for doing it!Only issue is the camera, don't get me wrong, it's great for standard shots, wide angle for group selfies (if that's your thing), even takes great night time shots with flash or using HDR feature, burst shots are quick, it even has a manual control mode to adjust aperture, iso settings, etc so you can take clear motion shots with no blur. But it stinks at macro shots, anything closer than 2 feet is a blur, even with manual settings and selecting where to aim on the screen. But that is still not a reason to ignore the great value you get with this phone. Also shoots clear video in 1080p (Says you can do 4k, but I haven't figured that out) and has slow motion recording option. Battery life is great, lasts all day even when used for gaming and streaming videos, also charges super fast. Full charge from 5% in less than 2 hours and that's when left on, even faster if you shut it off. On top of that you get a thumb print reader, such a time saver! Great phone all around, and definitely happy with my purchase."
"on June 3, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,HELLO MOTO!,"OMG, I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!! Yes, it comes pre-loaded with bloat-ware, yes there are ads on the second screen, but you can just slide them away. But it also came loaded with a lot of stuff that I use daily, so it made my life easier to not have to download and install it all myself! The phone itself is fabulous, a nice large screen, fabulous graphics (do they call images on a cell phone graphics? whatever, they're gorgeous!) the colors are rich and full, the sound is wonderful... I simply love this phone! It's truly factory unlocked, so you can go with any company you want. It takes GORGEOUS pics, too, I was so surprised that a phone could take pics as good as many digital cameras! I strongly recommend this phone, and the price is unbelievable for all that you get!!! This was one of my best purchases from Amazon!"
"on April 11, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a phone that does not cost 700 dollars that has excellent performance,"Excellent phone for an outstanding price,,Fast and responsive with no freeze ups like so many of the other phones in this price range always seem to have, I have always been hesitant of buying a cheaper phone and like many others have been caught up in the trap of always getting the newest and most expensive models. While this phone does not offer all the bells and whistles of the insanely priced models that only go  up more and more each year it is still a excellent phone and a fantastic buy,,"
"on May 19, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice phone, good value.","I bought this as a replacement for the Moto G4+ that was bricked by the update to Android 7 (rapid battery drain, Play Store doesn't work, individual apps crash frequently and the phone reboots spontaneously).  I reasoned that the G5+ shipping with Android 7 already installed must work better than the ""upgraded"" G4+.  The G5+ running Android 7 is indeed a whole lot better than the G4+ running Android 7, and it's also better than the G4+ running Android 6, but not enough to warrant buying the replacement vis-a-vis the G4+ running Android 6.It's great to see the magnetometer (compass) restored to the Moto G series (present in the G3, lost in the G4+, but reinstated in the G5+).  The overall response is snappier thanks to the faster processors.  The enhanced fingerprint sensor (that does double duty as a navigation aid) is a great idea.  It's really annoying that Lenovo decided to swap the locations of the on/off and volume buttons since I instinctively press the wrong buttons, but I guess I'll get used to it.All those things that went haywire with the G4+ don't happen with the G5+, so life is good again.  It's just a shame that the G4+ only worked for less than 6 months.  Hopefully the G5+ will last longer.  In this regard I also have a G3 that I bought 15 months ago and that's still working fine.  However, the G5+ is a significant improvement over the G3."
"on April 12, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Freezing phone,"UpdatedGot a new one; finger print scanner works just fine, but I keep getting a message that Google App has stopped. It happens at least 8 time an hour while using the phone. I have sent request for aid to Google with logs and nothing. We started several times, nothing. Returning again. Not sure I want a replacementLove the phone but need to return and see if next one works. Fingerprint scanner stopped working within 2 weeks. It is now freezing my phone when I try to get it to work. Tried turning off and restarting, nothing. Waited for the latest update, nothing. Will update with the next one"
"on June 16, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phone, could we also have something smaller?","Great phone, Moto is doing a lot things right with the latest batch of the G phones, I just wish there's a more reasonable sized G again.  I bought the G4 play specifically for its smaller size for my wife.  Now we just upgraded hers to this G5 plus, the only thing keeps me from getting rid of my iPhone SE is the HUGE size of the latest crop of Android phones.  I need a 5 inch or smaller FHD phone to go back to android on.  If the G5 was 5 inch (or even a bit smaller) with small bezels, I would be completely sold. Losing the replaceable battery is also a shame.  I understand Moto g% may have a smaller play version, we need this in the US please with a replaceable battery and FHD screen.I actually started my career as a EE with Motorola in the 90's, when it was still a US brand from a US company, but Lenovo is doing well with the brand, I am glad the brands is still around.  Keep up the good work."
"on July 14, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great so far,So far so good. My MotoG4 died after 10 months and wasn't covered under their standard warranty for a loose charging port. I use Republic Wireless so I got the unlocked G5 Plus and I couldn't be happier so far after two weeks. Hopefully it lasts more than 10 months...but as I've been telling my iPhone fanatic friends and family--even if it dies after a year that's 4 years of annual upgrades for less than the price of a single iPhone and I still come out way ahead because they will upgrade within 4 years and be out $1600 to my $400...and that's not counting a quality phone model that may last multiple years.I can't say I'm sold on the fingerprint scanner and may choose not to use it. I'm just afraid of it breaking like other users state on here but there's always a passcode or pattern backup. It is convenient but I just feel like my fingerprints are going to be easily stolen by a hacker at some point :-/Use the phone with Bitdefender mobile.
"on November 9, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice phone, it has enough space for everything","Very nice phone, it has enough space for everything.One side effect is when you mount the phone on the car's AC vent, and if it gets too cold, the screen starts tapping on random places on its own. I do NOT know if this is caused by the screen cover I have (which I made a review for), but it seems nice if the developers look into. But I'm sure it's caused by the protection screen.For its price, it looks nice and operates flawlessly.Although the camera isn't great, it is a perfect device for calls, running applications and connecting to the Internet which is pretty much every-day thing.The camera is good if there is enough light. I love how the camera borders around letters when taking pictures of projector slides, monitors and papers. I use the camera to take pictures of text a lot, and it fits my needs.The camera at night is not that good though."
"on May 17, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Would have been perfect if it was waterproof,"After I decided that the S7 was unacceptable, I had a dilemma. I could not go back to my 2015 Moto G, because I had given it to my mom so she could have an unlocked phone in Singapore. It seemed as though I had to give up on my desire for waterproofing as a core feature. The chipset that has the best battery life at the moment is the Snapdragon 625. Unlike the chipsets in the 800 series (or even the siblings in the 600 series), the 625 was actually designed for power efficiency. It was featured in the Moto Z Play phone last year, and while most phones don't get mentioned 6 months after they launch, the Moto Z Play is still getting rave reviews for stellar battery life.I somehow missed all the deals for the Moto Z Play, but the Moto G5 Plus launched recently, and uses the same chipset. Even better, if you have an Amazon Prime membership, you get $60 off for the 4GB RAM/64GB Storage version. My experience with the Blu R1 HD is that the Amazon add-ons to the phone aren't obtrusive, especially if you have lots of storage and so can forgive the non-deletable pre-installed apps. Having learned my lesson about storage, I decided to go for the larger storage version. 4GB of RAM can't hurt, since I did notice that the Moto G 2015 did frequently run with very little free space.Compared with the Moto Z Play, the Moto G5 Plus has:Smaller screen (5.2"" vs 5.5"")No NFC (the European versions have NFC but no compass!) NFC is nice, but as far as I can tell, none of the phone payment methods have really taken off, so it's a non issue. The compass is very useful when using any navigation apps, so I really appreciate that the US version has the compass.LCD screen vs AMOLED screen (no question, AMOLED screens are superior!)Smaller battery (3000mAH vs 3510 mAH)No Moto Mods (no big deal --- as of date there are no Moto Mods worth the price or weight or bulk)Lighter (156g vs 165g)Different camera (can't tell whether it's any better or worse, just different)4GB RAM (vs 3GB)64GB storage (vs 32GB storage)micro-USB vs USB C (this is a feature as far as I'm concerned --- no need to buy new cables!)No full-time ""OK Google"". (would have been nice to have, but I didn't have it on the 2015 Moto G or the S7 either!)Except for the smaller screen (and it seriously would have been nice to have an AMOLED screen), it didn't seem like it would have much of a compromise. In fact, in other ways (storage and RAM), the G5 Plus seems like the better phone.I bought the phone and got the free same day shipping. It arrived and I immediately tried the ""transfer data from a nearby phone"" feature of Android 7.0. Oh wow, Google Play Services crashed! And crashed! And crashed! I finally rebooted the phone and went back to setting up my phone the traditional way.After the setup, the phone was fast! Browsing, e-mail, and even taking pictures is reasonably fast with next to no lag. I was also very impressed by one of the new Moto gestures, which is to use the fingerprint reader as a substitute for the on-screen navigation buttons, recovering several pixels worth of space from the bottom of the screen. In fact, on-screen navigation buttons take up about 0.3inches of screen space, which effectively means that the 5.2inch screen on the Moto G Plus is now equivalent to the 5.5inch screen on the Moto Z Play! This is a great move and I wonder why other manufacturers don't do it.Sound quality and bluetooth seemed to work better than my 2015 Moto G, which would get audio stutter whenever a music player was being asked to multi-task with any other app. I guesss I was CPU limited but didn't even know it.And wow, storage! I didn't realize how constricted I'd been until I started installing apps and after more than 100 apps on the system the device still proclaimed that I had used only 6.84GB out of 53.71 on the internal storage. My 64GB micro SD card was definitely getting worked more., since it's the default storage location for photos, videos, etc.Note that both Moto Z Play and the Moto G5 Plus have headphone jacks, which is very nice since one of our cars and many of our high quality audio headphones still use the traditional system. In fact, none of the other Moto Z phones were ever under consideration because of this missing feature. I hope the Android ecosystem continues to thumb its collective noses at Apple's ""courage"" with regards to this user hostile move.The physical device feels slippery (I have no idea why anyone thinks that metal is superior to plastic for devices that you need to handle). At 156g, the device is pretty much the same as my old Moto G. Interestingly enough, the charger's much lighter than the one that came with the Moto X Pure. The Moto X Pure's charger is 110g (integrated cable), while the Moto G's charger is 52g with a 21g cable. The Samsung's charger was 42g by comparison.Surprisingly, I found myself using the fingerprint scanner. That's because it was fast and consistent. I wouldn't put up with it otherwise. Similarly, I found myself using the gestures to turn the screen off (hold the finger print sensor for 1s), or bring up Google assistant (hold the fingerprint sensor past the haptic feedback buzz).  I thought the fingerprint scanner would be a gimmick, but it's turned out to be quite reasonable. (The Samsung also used it for Samsung Pay, but with no NFC obviously I'm not going to be able to use Google Pay anyway!)And yes, ridewithgps works using Firefox on the Moto G5 Plus. One pleasant surprise is that WiFi calling works on T-mobile using the Moto G5 Plus, without any special configuration. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, that's the only feature I got from Nougat that was noteworthy.Battery life has been nothing short of incredible, coming from both the S7 and the Moto G 2015. I regularly end the day plugging the phone in and seeing that the battery level is at 40%. This gives me hope that running Live Tracking while riding all day won't kill the battery on the phone.All in all, I'll be keeping the phone for a while. The lack of waterproofing bothers me, but I guess I'll pack away my phone when it rains into a waterproof bag.Recommended."
"on July 20, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"I loved this phone when I first got it. It's now 3 months later and I merely like it. It feels good. It looks good.  I've had many annoying problems and no one to ask for help.  There is a Lenovo help app on the phone, but attempts to use fail. It get errors such as ""site unavailable"" when I try to access the forum.  The most annoying problems I've had are 1) unexplained high RAM usage, crippling the phone (was I hacked?  wouldn't rule it out), 2) bluetooth turning itself on (corresponds to previous condition), 2) Time/weather widget and any calendar widget not working 50% of the time (they just spin endlessly as if loading or trying to connect to my google account -- everything else connects just fine and it happens on wifi as well as cell), 3) occasional spontaneous rebooting.  I assumed all of these problems could be ""fixed"" by doing a factory reset.  These things are all annoying, but don't prevent me from having a usable phone. Sound is good -- I'm an obsessive ""listener"".  Voice recognition works pretty well. I like the fingerprint  authentication. That works pretty well, too.  I have never spent ""real"" money on a phone. I think this is a good one for the price. Given the issues I've had with RAM usage I can't imagine a 2GB phone doing the trick. This one has 64GB storage with 4GB ram and that seems adequate."
"on November 18, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Simple Honest Review,"I just sat here a read through at least 50 reviews for this phone without ever feeling like I actually learned something I couldn't already find in the product description. Not sure if people just enjoy confirming that a product is what it says it is or what but it's not very helpful. Anyway, enough rant, more review :)I have owned only 5 smartphones previous to the Moto G5 Plus (iPhone 3G, Samsung Infuse 4G, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Samsung Galaxy S5 Active, and an iPhone 6) as I tend to keep my devices for at least 2 years before upgrading. I will also add that, in general, I'm a heavy user of internet browsing, news apps and podcasts but not at all interested in social media or photography as it seems most users are focused. The few photos I have taken are more than adequate for their purpose although in low lighting scenarios I wouldn't expect great detail. The video recording however is stellar in all situations I've needed it. For me, the best features of this phone are the speed,  multitasking ability and battery life. After owning the phone nearly 6 months now it is still running just as fast and holding a charge just as long as it did the first week I fired it up. I was also able to simply remove the SIM card from my previous phone and get it working straight away without any activation steps or approval from my carrier (AT&T;) who doesn't even offer this phone. Even with at least 4-6 solid hours a day off use with multiple apps running and 50-70% average brightness, I only charge this phone for 90 minutes max every other day without fail. The iPhone 6 I had before this would barely last a full day and needed regular mid-day charging. I honestly can't find anything significantly wrong with this phone at all. Gone are the days that I will get suckered into some flagship device that costs 4x as much with little difference in performance. If you use your phone for the internet, daily use apps (banking, amazon shopping, weather, timers/alarms, reminders, etc.) and the occasional photo-op this is the only phone you should buy imo. I am rarely compelled to write a review for a product I've purchased but knowing that I could have saved literally thousands of dollars over the last 10 years speaks for itself. DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE ON FLAGSHIP PHONES!! Motorola's been in the game a long time and they still know what's up :)"
"on August 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME PHONE,"This phone is awesome. with 64 GB built in and I added a 128 GB SD card I now have plenty of storage on my phone and can add all the apps I want. My other phones you could only add some of your apps onto the SD card but with this phone you can add them all. The speaker phone works GREAT people Im talking with have no problems hearing me, all my other phones people were always saying they couldn't hear me this phone solved that. Being unlocked I had not trouble switch to this phone with my cell phone provider I simply put in the sim cards and called them and they put in my serial number and my service worked. This phone that Amazon offers is supper good and at a great deal especially since I bought it on the Amazon day. I was concerned that I would get a lot of ads from Amazon they are so minimal it does not bother me at all. Also the the 4 gig memory the phone is super fast. I am so happy I bought this phone, specially since it was at even a greater discount on Amazon day. Way to go Amazon."
"on May 6, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone for the Price,"I'll start off by saying this is a great device and works splendidly. I use it with Verizon wireless and it worked perfectly (I only had a problem on verizon's end with an incomplete activation of the phone with the sim). I will also be testing it out on China Unicom this June when I go over to China so I'll write about my experience with that if I remember to when I get back. The finger print button works great and is really convenient, I also use it as a back/home/applications button. The camera is pretty great quality for a phone this cheap as well, I haven't used it too much extensively but if I encounter a problem I'll come back to share. I don't really care too much about NFC since I've never really used it nor have I seen many people using it in my everyday life. May I also add that the processor and 4 GB of RAM on this thing makes for an impressive performance.The only two reasons why I'm not giving this 5 starts is:1. The speaker is not the loudest, I had a kyocera brigadier prior to this phone and the speaker on that little thing was able to get quite a bit higher than the speakers on this thing. It just gets annoying when you're in a semi-loud area or something in the background is just a tad too loud and you still can't hear the person on the other line too loud and clear with the speakerphone volume all the way up.2. I called Amazon wanting to pay off the remaining difference to get rid of the ads (this was a about a month after I got the phone, I had more money to spend) however the Amazon customer service person told me there was no way to get rid of the ads and I would have to return the device and buy the one without ads in order to do so. I thought ads could be taken off by Amazon if you paid the difference but I suppose not for this phone (If anyone knows a way to do so that the customer service person couldn't find please let me know)Overall I would definitely recommend this phone, not only for the price point but also for the quality it gives for that price point."
"on July 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent phone for the price!,"I'm extremely pleased with this phone. For the price, you are getting a phone with specs that a couple years ago would cost you nearly $700.. I'd recommend the 64gb, 4gb ram version with no ads, its totally worth it. 4GB of RAM for $300!!!.The Moto G5 Plus comes with nearly stock android 7 and with the 4gb of ram it is sssoooo smooth. Navigating between apps and launching is seamless. I nice feature is the quick twist to launch the camera, which is surprisingly good, and take a picture with nearly no delay. You can basically take photos as fast as you can press the capture button.I use it to play some games, emulation and GTA San andreas all of which runs super smooth.The battery life is also stellar and with light usage I can easily get through two days without charging. When I do the turbo charge feature is very handy.Overall, very pleased with the features with this phone and if you are in the market for a new android phone I highly recommend this as the performance and features at this price range are unbeatable."
"on April 25, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm having issues.,Very fast and sexy but I am having issues.  Poor phone reception due to the antenna.  If I hold the phone with two fingers on the edges at the bottom of the phone I can get clear voice on the phone.  If I cover the back with my hand in a manner of normal use the voice reception  goes unintelligible.  It frustrates me and who I'm talking to.
"on June 11, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,"like the phone, but disappointed with sim situation","got this phone for several reasons.  first it was reasonably priced and well rated.  second it was unlocked, and third it is advertised as having the capacity to use dual sim cards.  i am planning a trip out of the country and wanted to be able to use my phone where i was going with a local sim.  i obtained the sim, activated it and went to install it in the phone.  it was then that i discovered the phone is sold with a different sim tray in the US than the rest of the world.  the US tray fits one and only one sim card.  replacement dual sim trays are available from China but would not arrive in time.  i guess i will have to swap the card when i get where i am going and then swap back again when i arrive home.also of note is that the instructions that came with the phone show the dual sim tray and make no mention of there being two.i do like the phone display and functions.  it holds a charge for a long time and is versatile enough for me.  one complaint is that the volume on phone calls is not very loud.  btw, i don't even notice the ads for amazon and i use the amazon apps and like them."
"on April 26, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't beat the specs for the price - Great phone!,"I found this phone on Amazon by chance.  I was not aware of these phones with ads and I don't mind the ads as I have them on my Fire.  The ads are on the lock screen and don't bother me - saved $60 with the 64gb phone - Wow!Pro: The specs on this phone are great and it is fast.  I use Blue Iris surveillance software and the app updates with 4 cameras; used to freeze my old phone but not so with this phone.  Really great specs for this price range.  Android 7 and I don't need a SD card with 64gb memory.Con: The camera protruded out of the case so when you laid your phone on it's back, it was actually laying on the camera lens.  Would rather have a flat back then a protrusion. Could cause some point loading, possible point of failure.  I got the Yootech tempered glass screen protector and the Spigen Rugged Armor case - they fit fine and the protrusion on the back is now protected.I have Republic Wireless (RW) for my phone service and this is one of the few phones that you can ""Bring your own phone"" and this is really the best choice in this price range.  The sim card is on Amazon as well at $5 which is same price as RW site.  I got my phone and sim card in 2 days, charged it, put the sim card in, backed up my old phone to Google, turned on the phone, signed into google account, and downloaded the RW app from the Play store, went online chat with RW and they walked me through setting up my phone in just a few minutes.  Using my old phone number and all my apps updated (did have to sign back into some of them).  Easy."
"on September 20, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing phone for $500-700 less than an iPhone!,"Amazing phone for $500-700 less than an iPhone!I have used iPhones for years, the last being an iPhone 6+. When I went to change carriers I couldn't get my iPhone 6+ unlocked. I'd been thinking of trying one of the new Samsung phones but I thought I'd try this one to see if I could live with Android after many years using IOS.The phone is solidly built, has all the features I want (camera, bluetooth,, headphone jack,  fingerprint sensor - oh wait iPhone X left those out ;-), and seems plenty fast. The flashlight is actually brighter than my iPhone's and easier to turn on (2 quick shakes). I also love how I can silence the ringer just by placing the phone face down or having a time set to turn the ringer back on (can turn the ringer off for a set period of time).I haven't done much with the camera but it takes decent pictures.I am certainly not in a rush to plunk down $800-$1000 for a new phone. I'm very happy with this one."
"on April 29, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just Buy It,"This phone is sinfully good considering the price. My ONLY complaint is the lack of USB-C, but c'mon, look at that price. In addition to being a wonderful android device, the Moto G Plus is a Motorola device! That means the wonderful gestures that Motorola devices are known for such as twisting for camera and chopping for light.The fingerprint sensor deserves its own paragraph. WHAT A SENSOR! The size is perfect, the responsiveness can put many flagships to shame, and the fingerprint sensor gestures are a gift from on high. I don't know how I ever got along without fingerprint sensor gestures, but I'm glad I have them now!"
"on August 18, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy if you like to understand what the other person is saying!,"So I have had this phone since April, at first it seemed like a great device, but then the troubles started. I could not understand anything the person on the other end was saying. I would reboot and it would be fine for a couple of hours then calls would break up again.So figuring it was a bad phone I exchanged it for another.Same problems. After doing some research I found lots of people we're having the same thing happening to them.Went to the Lenovo/Moto forums and found a thread about this problem.Lenovo has known about it since April. And they kept saying they are working on it.On August 16th they released a ""fix"" but after 3 days it still has not uploaded to my phone.What's worse is that a few people have responded saying the problem still exists.I'm ready to find a new non Moto phone."
"on August 22, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nearly vanilla android with Nougat and with specs on par with more expensive phones,"I was reluctant to get this phone and was thinking of holding out for the newer version of the Moto X, but having used this phone for a little over a couple of months, I really like it a lot!  It's fast, responsive, i've not had any weird issues with bluetooth or call drops.  It's just the perfect size for me, not too big and not too small and i like all of the new features that come with Nougat that are built in.  The Turbo Charger is great and really does cut down charging time.  I would have to say the only negatives I have about the phone are the lack of NFC (can't use android pay) and that sometimes the earpiece and speakerphone are not loud enough.  Other than that I have no real complaints.  And now that it seems like you'll get on average 3-4 years out of a phone before you have to replace it, this is at just the right price vs the phones that are $500+"
"on July 30, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Technology Advances Rapidly in the Moto G5 Plus,"Compared to my 4 year-old Moto G, it is clearly evident in the Moto G5 Plus how rapidly technology continues to advance.  The lightening-fast speed of the operating system and applications, particularly the photo application, is truly astonishing.  Beyond speed, the improvement in the quality of photos and videos that the phone produces is also quite an achievement.  I'm also impressed with the high quality of the LCD screen, which is very sharp and bright enough to easily view in broad daylight.  It has been a snap to connect to my T-Moble account and transfer my Android contacts and other information stored on my old machine or in the Cloud.  I especially enjoy use of the fingerprint sensor to navigate the Android pages and thereby make available additional space for icons on the screen.The one minor drawback I find is that the Moto G5 Plus is somewhat bulky, the result of both its considerable size and weight."
"on August 12, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone and really a great price for what you get.,"Great phone compared to anything I've had before, some of which were higher end phones though I've never felt the need to drop $600+ for any of the ""flagship"" phones that don't do anything more. Had the original Moto G, then Moto G LTE, and enjoyed both though they were on the slower side. This phone is more akin to 2nd tier phones, i.e. just below company's flagship models. Happy I got the Prime Day deal on this with the 4gb ram. Didn't really need the 64gb memory, but the extra ram memory certainly makes this phone quick at everything I throw at it. Waiting for another deal like the Prime Day deal to upgrade my wife's phone. Using it on Cricket Wireless and no problems there. Easy to upgrade using online chat at no cost. Need a nano sim, so depending on what your previous phone has, you might need to go to the store and buy one (Best Buy often runs deals on Cricket SIM cards)."
"on October 22, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Worldwide Phone,I bought this to replace a five year old phone since the battery in the old phone was getting weak. I had almost given up trying to find a phone that would work seamlessly worldwide. I saw a review that this one was a true world phone and got it. My carrier is Verizon so not only do they use different frequencies but Verizon uses CDMA instead of GSM. I just spent two weeks with relatives in England and it worked without a hitch. When I got to England I bought an English SIM card with EE (Orange) and as soon as I popped the card in I had my English phone number and was online. Not only does the phone work worldwide but it is a very nice phone with entirely adequate features. The absence of NFC has no effect on me either in the USA or England. I live in a very rural area and my relatives also live in a rural area. It seems to me that the only place you can find a merchant that accepts NFC is in big cities.
"on April 17, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok phone - Very small usable screen - Bad interface,"I guess for the price the phone is OK. It's no flagship phone, that you can tell as soon as you run a benchmark on it, not from the result (50.000 something) but from the fact that the graphics are choppy while the benchmark is running. I guess with this price range you can't ask much?It gets 3 stars though because there is a fingerprint scanner which takes half inch space on the front of the phone and does not serve any other purchase, add the 3 software home keys, back etc...and you lost 1/4 of the front of the phone. Now Amazon comes in ads the google search on the top and you have 4"" phone left, this is ridiculous...Android 7 yes, but when I am running 2 apps simultaneously, the soft keys are still there, so thanks but no thanks, the phone is definitely not 5.2"" at the end...People here mention the performance, I guess it is what it is for the money, keep in mind this is a Snapdragon 625 which is the cheap option of an 820. And to top that I just noticed the 4 ""spotlights"" in the display, on the top of the phone! I actually think this is how it's supposed to be!RecapPros:4GB RAMAndroid 7Dual SIMSD CardDual Flash4K VideoMany bandsVoLTE & WiFi CallingOTG supportWide lens for selfiesCons:Very bad interface!

"on June 9, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not as simple as I expected,"this phone has a cdma and a gsm radio which means it can be activated on sprint and att.  I was led to believe all you had to do was purchase a sprint sim card and plug it in.  I used a sprint sim card from one of my active phones and plugged it in.  It got me on the sprint network but I couldn't use my plan with it.  It seems that you still have to call sprint and have them activate the sim card you are using, even if it is already activated.  Oh well, I activated a new sim card and it would fine with my plan.  the phone is great, it works well with calls and data."
"on September 24, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,This new phone is slower than my 4-year-old Moto X 1st Gen. Regret.,"So, I appreciate that the battery life of this phone is fairly sufficient, and there appears to be a decent amount of space memory wise, but for some reason this phone just can't seem to handle its own Google system. Much of the phone takes ridiculous amounts of time to reflect an action, particularly Google Search, Google Voice. Needs to be restarted fairly often in order to function. Requires a cleanup app to be revisited regularly. I had a little bit of lag with my last phone, but it was borderline 4 years old (Moto X 1st Gen). I went with Motorola again because I liked my last phone. This phone has been a huge disappointment, and if it weren't for the solid battery life, I'd have switched back to my old phone by now. I wish I'd have returned it the minute I saw it acting slow. It's only getting worse, and I've already tried cleaning up application space and I already have an SD card for space as well. This phone was a waste of my money, and I'll probably be getting another within the next 4 months, because I can't imagine that it'll even make it to 6 months.That being said, the Amazon addendum that has products and whathaveyou advertised to you, it doesn't appear to be that big of a deal.If you buy this phone, buy the warrantee."
"on August 20, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Bang for the Bucks!,I had a Samsung Galaxy S5 for last 3+ years and it started failing miserably. I do not want to buy another Samsung Galaxy S8 or something else which would cost me $550+ range. This Moto G5 plus is much more than what I was used to Samsung Galaxy S5. Android 7.0 Nugget is excellent. There is not much customization done by Motorola. I believe it is bare product Android 7.0 Nugget installed on Qualcomm Snapdragon 625  2GHz processor with 4GB sd-ram drive. There is plenty of space of 64GB. I have mounted my old mini sd card of 128GB and it works well. The screen is FullHD 1080p with 424 ppi is excellent. The camera works superbly.  I am very happy with my Moto G5 plus and will readily recommend the product to anyone.PS: Today I received a trade-in offer email from Samsung for S8 which was slightly less than $500/- I decided to ditch that offer.

"on May 9, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"This is my first budget phone and it works really well just like the LG V10 that came out last year. The Moto G5 plus is really fast at responding and that is a plus for me. I have heard and watch videos about this phones pro's and cons and one of them was that it did not have GPS. Which is a lie. I am an Uber/Lyft driver at first it seem true about the GPS but you just have to go to settings and set it up to High accuracy from battery saving mode. In addition the battery power it is really good. Once I charged my phone completely it last me all day. I watch lots of videos, play lots of games, watch movies and browse the internet and it last me all day. Sometimes I don't have the battery full and it still last me all day. Basically this phone does pretty much everything compare to $700 - $ 1000 phones."
"on December 8, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this phone!,"I absolutely love this phone. Especially in comparison to upgrading from an iPhone 5c. I was so sick of the endless, storage-eating iOS upgrades. This phone has great interface, is easy to learn and use, has tons of data storage, does automatic backup to Google of my pictures and videos, and in short has so many more features than my iPhone, it blows me away. I can't imagine myself ever paying three to five times the cost of Moto to get a new iPhone. I will never get an iPhone again. It's Android all the way for me from now on."
"on June 24, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Up to par with the flagship phones at a fraction of the cost.,"I had the phone about 2 weeks now. Love it so far.Pros:Cost, Fast, Responsive, Good call quality, Great on T-Mobile network, Gesture shortcut for Camera, battery, and camera take good picturesCons:Video or music sound is low and tinny, location of home and back buttons, and Gesture shortcut for FlashlightNote on Gesture shortcuts:Holding phone twist you wrist left and right opens camera, works awesome never fails to launch, I love this feature.Holding phone make a shaking hands motion or karate chop motion opens flashlight, this does not work very well I just about broke my wrist trying to get this to work, works like 1 in 10 tries, to bad this doesnt work well I would like it if it did.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone, my opinion it is in par with the flagship phones at a fraction of the cost.  Think about it if one upgrades every 2 years with this type of phone your still spending less than the cost of 1 flagship phone, and frankly there not much better!"
"on August 20, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Two decades of R&D; later: smartphones are still unreliable.,"Cons: - Buttons are way too easy to accidentally press:  twice a week I find that the phone has turned itself completely off or has changed it's own volume settings. - Power button on side of phone is very annoying:  simply holding it the wrong way is enough to accidentally lock the phone. - The gesture system for the camera cannot be turned off:  I delete about 100 photos of the inside of my pocket every month because walking activates the camera. - Frequent freezes:  particularly when waking the phone (as in an alarm going off, or when turning on the screen), the phone will lock up for 2-15 seconds.  It is *extremely* annoying when the phone ignores all your attempts to silence an excessively loud alarm (see above).Pros: - Very cheap - Reasonable camera and mic - Makes calls, reads e-mails, searches Google."
"on June 3, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Brand New Generation Phone for only $240 Dollars!,"I absolutely love this phone, I was looking in the market for a cheap phone that is still better than my previous Samsung Galaxy S4. Then I heard about this. I questioned the Amazon version thinking I will be spammed with ad's every time I open the phone. But I was so wrong saving $60 while getting all the amazon features I know and love as a prime member was to good to be true. The phone itself didn't feel cheap it had a sturdy metal backing to it, and very responsive finger print sensor, a good size, and great cameras. Overall I would highly recommend this phone if you are looking to upgrade and not spend a stupid amount a popular brand name and still get all the key functionality."
"on September 15, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone at Twice the Price,I got this after being burned by a defective HTC 10 that failed days after its warranty expired and the provider refused to bend.  This is a great phone at twice the price.  I love the card slot as I can put a ton of movies and TV shows on it for work.  The battery holds enough charge to watch all my shows for the 10 hour shift with power to spare.  Plenty of processing power as I've never been able to slow it down with the games or apps I have installed.  I could care less that the screen resolution is 1080--it still looks great and is very bright.  The camera is not as sharp as the one on my HTC 10 but it does the job.  I encountered the same problem talking on the phone as others have but I disabled enhanced 4G LTE mode as found on Lenovo forums and there is issue is gone.  (I blame Verizon for this more than anything)  Bottom line: best phone for the price.
"on May 27, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moto 5G Plus (64gb internal memory with 4gb ram),"Moto 5G Plus.  I got the 64gb internal memory with 4gb ram.  This phone is awesome. I was looking for a great unlocked phone with great specs, 4gb ram, 64gb internal memory, fast prcessor, great price, no software bloat ware embedded in the phone, great battety. This for is it.  You can get it with ads for $240 or no ads for $300. Wow,  a great deal and AWESOME phone. It has Android 7.0 Nougat, which is spartan but very quick with no software bloat ware. In 7.0, the SD card can be formatted to internal,  so you have one large internal flash drive. Awesome. I love this phone.  Had the S4 and S5 and switched to Motorola. Very happy."
"on June 21, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PHONE,"Great phone--a real upgrade from my beloved iPhone4. WiFi calling great! Camera not Ansel Adams but perfectly adequate for a phone. Very fast, will expand storage for my music in near future with memory card-Apple can't do that. Works easily with Bluetooth in Hyundai Santa Fe, location accuracy good.  Was looking at the Moto 4 before the G5 Plus was released, Sooo glad I waited!  Left Verizon after 20+ years and went with Republic Wireless, very happy so far with their service.  And the best part--with the Moto G5 Plus I can change carriers whenever I choose.  Doesn't feel like a budget phone, thin and good screen size, not too big.  Amazon ads not intrusive."
"on October 7, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice phone for the price,"I've had this phone for about 2 months now and over all I like it. Got it during Amazon day or something so it was discounted. There are some features I miss from my old phone and I'm not too crazy about the contact setup, messaging app, and some other little things but I'm happy with my purchase. People seem to have a hard time hearing me on this phone too. The lock screen ads are no big deal and with the saving. I don't mind the preloaded Amazon apps either. The size is good and it's not too heavy. I'm not a big techy phone person so this does what I need it to and so far I haven't had many issues. Camera takes nice pictures. We'll see how long it last since things are just made to last until the next model release these days. Previous phone started acting up around 10 months so I'm hoping that's not the case this time!"
"on September 16, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best value ever.,I love this phone. For the price it cannot be beat. Battery lasts all day and it's buttery smooth. I came from an iPhone 6s plus which required recharge by lunchtime and was slow by the time I replaced. Android OS is far more advanced than ios.

"on September 28, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Android Phone under $200,"Over all it's a great phone with very high C/P. Scored one with 4GB/64GB on the Prime day, few months later it's still runs great. Wish MOTO would've kept releasing new firmware and security patches like they used to. Unfortunately once Lenovo took over the company they don't really care about the firmware updates anymore."
"on July 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice phone for seniors too!,We bought 2 of these. Gold for me and grey for my husband. We had Moto G4's but they only had 2GB of ram. We had them for a while but wanted 4GB phones. We opted for the no ad version. They work great with Tracfone. We are very happy with them.
"on September 17, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated review,I found that the Google app and Launcher was causing the freezing and restarting. I disabled Google and downloaded Microsoft launcher and so far it's great. I really love the phone and hope this fixes the problem.I loved the phone and features when I received it. But for 3 weeks now it has been freezing and restarting alot. I'm hoping that it doesn't die on me. I would like to know if there is a fix for this.
"on August 26, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lousy Phone,This phone is a very weak phone. I do not ask much of a smartphone typically text message web surfing and email. This phone will not even receive text messages and email if you are on a phone call. The Bluetooth functionality is weak and it struggles to connect with devices you have already established a relationship with. I use it in my Jeep which has a aftermarket radio and the phone will automatically connect to it when I start the vehicle but it will not play anything and so I have to manually disconnected and reconnected for it too sync and play music. A terrible choice and I highly recommend if you are considering this phone that you choose another option even if it is more pricey.
"on August 13, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good","So far so good, very nice phone, I wish it was a 5.5 inches screen, the sound from the speakers leaves a lot to be desired, i had to get a different app for the camera did not like the one provided by MOTO/LENOVO the battery of this phone is amazing, no lag or stutters very happy with so far, I have had it for over a month and I am quite happy with it, I wish that the screen was a little brighter My Idol 3 from Alcatel had a better screen than the MOTO G 5 Plus."
"on November 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone. Absolutely love it,"Great phone. Absolutely love it, and highly recommend it. There are a few annoyances, but nothing that makes me regret my purchase. I was worried about the Amazon Ads when purchasing, but they have proven to be the definition of unobtrusive. Tip- If you use an app that has a permanent lock screen notification, such as Weather Bug, then you will never see the full screen Amazon ads; you'll only get the small bar notification ad."
"on August 1, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,The Moto G5 plus is a very good phone. But it has a real problem,"The Moto G5 plus is a very good phone. But it has a real problem, I got my phone 3 days before the sim card came. So I installed the uSD card and setup the phone on Wifi. When I got the sim card the the card tray would not open. It was stuck. Seems that you have to put both cards in at same time to  fit. This is not good for a 4band unlocked phone to cave a weak try slot. To bad as this is a great phone otherwise."
"on September 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moto G Plus(5th generation) 64Gb is awesome and since it's a unlocked gsm phone,"I 'm enjoying my new phone, The first Motorola i had lasted me 7 years.

"on August 17, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone for the price,"I picked one of these up from Costco (32 GB version).  It's an excellent phone for the price.  It's very responsive and has lots of nice features.  I love the fingerprint scanner and the bright high-res screen.  The only feature I wish was better is the camera.  It's a lot better than my last phone's camera (BLU R1 HD), but not as good as an iPhone's.  Given the price, it's an excellent value."

"on July 5, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Moto G5 plus.  Good phone, ads and offers - not so much.","I messed up.  I thought I was buying the unadulterated phone.  I got the one with ads and offers.  I need the phone, so I'll probably keep it.  I just activated it today and it seems to work fine.  32 GB of memory at this price is a huge bonus.  My previous 8GB starter phone with my AT&T; contract was almost out of memory when it was activated.  Moto G5 is a huge improvement. I thought I was getting a ""Prime Deal""  on the Moto G5.  Ads and offers are extremely annoying and there is no way to get rid of them.  MY MISTAKE.  NOT THE FAULT OF AMAZON.  My wife will actually be using this phone, so maybe she won't notice.  This would be a 4 or 5 star product without the ads.. Maybe I'll learn to read the ""Prime"" offers a little closer."
"on April 6, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Only 2G of RAM?,"My only complaint is that I don't know why they'd only put 2GB of RAM in this phone.  I'd rather trade off some storage space for more RAM.  The Android OS takes up nearly half of the RAM, so there's not really much left for everything else.  My phone constantly runs at about 90% or more of RAM used.  I haven't had any problems with it slowing down, though--yet."
"on November 1, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone to start with but quickly fails you,Owned the phone for less than 4 months. 3 months in it started to have trouble sending and receiving MMS messages. I had to put it into airplane mode and back again multiple times in order to get the MMS message to download. I also experienced a multitude of issues getting it to sync to my cars bluetooth and other bluetooth devices. After these two issues the finger print sensor stopped working entirely. The phone didn't even recognize it had a fingerprint sensor as the option to change or edit the fingerprint options was entirely missing. After searching online I found this to be a common problem that often required the phone to be repaired. I opted out of fixing such a faulty phone and cut my losses.Buyer beware. Awesome phone to start with but quickly fails you.
"on September 7, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete waste of money,"I've had this less than three months. It's super glitchy. It freezes, gives me a black screen, self restarts, all several times a day. I'm using very little of the space on the phone. Motorola has been useless in helping to solve the problem. Complete waste of money. A friend has this phone and loves it, but I definitely got a lemon, and I'm stuck with it. It's barely usable."
"on September 9, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phone, but the case is slippery and not very sturdy.","Good phone and very easy to use. Since I had an old Asus phone, this is a vast improvement over it.The only reason why I took off a star is that the case itself is very slippery to hold. I am still waiting for my protective case from Amazon, so unfortunately, this slipped out of my hand and dropped on hard concrete. The edges are painted to look like metal, but are really made of plastic. There are now chunks missing from the corner edges, and you can see the exposed plastic underneath.I have dropped my old Asus phone quite a few times in the past, and it always survived the falsl and stayed intact. This phone which costs 5X what my old phone cost is a lot less sturdy."
"on August 14, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Device ""was"" everything I wanted, out of a phone. It had a nicer screen, metal body, newer android, and it was priced right.","Good:The metal body is really nice, the screen is prefect, ads aren't all that annoying, fingerprint sensor works great, loud speaker, great battery, fast battery charging(1hr or less), and the one button navigation.BAD:Well here is where I wish I bought my old phone (Moto G3) again. It doesn't have any water proofing, I like to use my phone while swimming....yea...I know. It doesn't get any signal where my old phone did, I can get 3 bars with my old phone, 0 with this:( Music streaming services consistently stop working, due to the horrible antenna, plus it seems to freeze quite a lot...I mean a loooot. Good luck using the google browser, it runs slowww."
"on July 19, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly fast phone with long battery life!,"For the price, nothing beats this phone! It's well built and the clean stock Android experience is super fast and easy to use! Even though it doesn't have a flagship cpu, it's very fast. I only wish they included nfc for Android pay. This is clearly the best budget phone out. It even beats out many midrangers too. I love it!"
"on September 5, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent phone,"Great replacement for my old Galaxy S5.  Works fine on Verizon, and near-stock Android is a great experience.  Why spend more than twice as much for a flagship model from any manufacturer, unless you must have NFC or absolute waterproofing?  This phone has no drawbacks or shortcomings for me in actual use. Very good performance and great value."
"on November 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent phone for a decent price,"I have had an iPhone for at least the past 5-6 years. Switched over to this & I don't want to go back. It's very user friendly, does everything I want & has a nice camera."

If not on their turbo charger and you charge in your car it doesn't charger. This is the second one I got and the first had the same issue.I have tried this phone on both T-Mobile and Verizon. You think it's working fine until people start asking why you didn't call or text back. So you don't know there is a problem until after you can't return it. Then Motorola is happy to have you send it in and wait for them to evaluate it pay then more money for a quick ship replacement. Tech support is useless and doesn't know the phone all that well. Then falls back onto a $25 charge to have it sent back for them to service. No thanks, I'm done with this phone and the company. Such a disappointment."

There are times when I have to touch the screen multiple times to get a response, if at all. Earlier tonight I touched the screen in the same place 4 times with no response and then the phone reset itself! I hooked up the phone to my computer with a USB cable and it shows that it is gaining a charge, but there is no charge message for me to edit to allow the phone to transfer files to/from my computer.

Right out of the box before entering the Google account or a single new app the phone broke out in a fit of ghost typing and freezing. Have since discovered these are old time G series issues, which is rather odd. Kept happening and have since flushed system cache plus turned off every non-vital app from touching system settings. Still freezes several times a time for five or 10 seconds at a time. Today the phone did an out of the blue screen clear and killed a phone call mid-conversation. I want to like this thing despite the distinctly poor camera and the unworkable OS/hardware bugs. The Lenovo support site is a horror show. It wanted to merge some ancient account with a new form of access. After getting through that the links were broken to G5 support. With support as bad as the product, this thing will go back.

Going with 5.2"" and HUGE bezels is neither comfortable for one hand use nor ideal for multimedia. Why not make 5"" and 5.5"" versions with reasonable bezels and make everyone happy? Bezels like on the p10 would have been perfect.Oh and 32/2, 64/4 memory pricing is a classic scumbag apple move. Wholesale NAND flash is dirt cheap..."

While great phones hardware wise updates were few and far between despite promises that updates would be fast and timely you'll be lucky to be upgraded to the next version of Android and if you are it will be a year after that version is released before you get it...if you get it.  And security patches forget about it, last security patch I received was over 6 months ago.  With new security threats emerging every day this is unacceptable.  I urge anyone who is concerned about the security of their information to avoid motorola phones until they can demonstrate they can provide fast and timely updates to their phones as they've promised for the past 3yrs but have failed to deliver."
"on September 12, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Must return,Received phone yesterday and have no idea what to do with it as instructions say put in sim cards and none are in pkg. I cannot understand why we are given such tiny incomplete instructions made for and by nerds!
"on April 6, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Supposed to save 60 not waste 70.,"I was supposed to save money not waste it on a cell service that will not work, has no service in my area. Western Maine. Cricket wireless, which is one of the ones that Amazon suggests when you purchase the phone. I checked with Cricket and they told me there was service in my area. BIG NEWS FLASH!! THERE IS NOT!! so I not only wasted 10 dollars for the sim card but also wasted 60 dollars to activate the service. Which they will not reimburse. Then I had to spend another 50 dollars to get service else where. and the case that was suggested along with it which I also bought was supposed to be clear 2 piece and they send me a black  one piece! ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!! I actually could give the phone a good review."
