"March 27, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,"I've bought my Motto G5 Plus 64 GB on Friday the 24th, and in my opinion its great improvement from the Moto G4 Plus 64 GB as it does not heat up and the updated fingerprint sensor is an improvement. The screen is smaller, but I can live with it. I would recommend this phone to my family and friends that do not want to spend big bucks on a cell phone and get a good one for $299 which I believe is worth it."
"April 6, 2017",4,Beats even the high dollar flagship phones,"The Moto-G line has always been awesome in my opinion. The Moto G4 was by far the best phone I had ever owned because of its barebone performance. The Moto g5 plus though enters a whole new realm of performance, power, and battery life. This phone has the same camera as the Samsung S7 Active, runs an 8 core CPU that clocks higher than many of today's laptops. I've been an IT professional all of my working career and this pocket computer packs in 4gb of ram, which essentially is about the same amount of ram that most office PCs use. Overall I have zero complaints about the Moto g5 when it comes to specs and performance.. I run most of my graphics design and graphics editing applications right from my phone without a single hiccup yet can make 2 full days of constant usage on a single batter charge. I am disappointed in Lenovo for discontinuing the Moto waterproof features and only offering water repellant features, there's no reason for this nonsense. Aside from that I only have one true complaint and it has nothing to do with the Moto G5s capabilities. Lenovo marketed the G5 as a metal device, but that claim is false. The back is metal, not the whole frame."
"April 2, 2017",5,Excellent phone so far. Great value.,"I have been very happy with the first 2 days on this phone. Phone seems quick to respond and has all the capability that I expect. It is an upgrade from my 1 1/2 year old Samsung S5. I had a S7 for a while before having to go back to a S5 and it seems to be as fast as I remember that phone. I went with the 64GB version to also get the 4GB RAM. I don't know if that makes much of at difference but this combination is working fast and was very fast when transferring data from my old phone or cloud backups. 64GB also lets me put on just about any app I want for a while.

It has been an easy transition to the features of Moto. I originally thought the fingerprint scanner was in a terrible spot but it turns out to be very easy to use it there and I use it instead of the pattern to turn on the phone. I also thought they were wasting real estate with the back and home buttons on the screen but you can select to use the fingerprint button for swiping to replace the on screen buttons to go back, home or see open items and gain back the screen real estate. It is actually easier to use than finding the buttons on the screen.

Battery life seems reasonable so far but time will tell. It is at 80% after 7 hours of use today with a lot of data moving via wifi but no phone call usage. It went down further yesterday but with more phone usage and not all wifi. I'm hoping that the battery life turns out OK. It does charge fast.

Phone worked immediately on ATT by just moving the SIM card from my old phone. No issues on hookup. 

Negatives vs Samsung's: no wireless charging and not water proof.
Positives: Performance is good, a lot less expensive and unlocked."
"April 4, 2017",5,A phone similar to the HTC M9 below half the price,"Gone are the days where you need spend $750 for a top of the line phone.

Granted the HTC M9 came out over a year ago. So in that sense it is not a fair comparison. Yes the HTC M9 has NFC, which this phone does not. But beyond that, pretty similar. Same screen resolution. 4GB of RAM instead of 3GB. The camera on the M9 is more MP but the overall quality of the cameras is similar.

The point I'm trying to make is that waiting nearly 2 years gives you a very comparable phone at below half the cost. The Moto G5 Plus runs smoothly and has a sharp looking screen. This phone would have been among the top of the line in 2015. And it is not priced anywhere close to top of the line.

Great value for a very good phone."
"April 12, 2017",5,Great phone at this price!,"I purchased this phone at Best Buy store on 4/09. Had it activated at Verizon corporate store on Monday-literally took the man 10 minutes and I was out the door with everything working great! Excellent battery life I left everything on(sync,Bluetooth,data,brightness at half)streamed music at work for 8 hrs,surfed internet(including videos) about 4 hrs,a few calls and texts,and still had over 30 percent battery at 10pm(started at 6am)! Great screen,snappy performance,love the Moto functions especially the twist for camera! The fingerprint scanner has worked flawlessly- I set mine up for both thumbs and 1 index finger and set scanner to replace on screen buttons-what a great idea! The camera is good- I'd say above average. Call quality is very good as is signal strength- both data and call. Bluetooth works perfect- hooked right up to my Chevy truck and my headphones. In my opinion, anyone looking for a smartphone for 300 bucks and under should absolutely check this phone out!"
"April 10, 2017",2,Major bug causes choppy audio on Verizon,"The phone is a great value in terms of build and performance. However, it is suffering from a major flaw for some folks who buy the unlocked version and use it on the Verizon network. Call reception becomes choppy to the point that the phone is not useable as a phone. This happens even when reception is outstanding; the other party can hear you fine - you just can't hear them. The issue is documented in a couple of places on the Lenovo forums, and I am hopeful that a fix will happen in the next couple of days, or I am taking the phone back (for the second time - thought it was a hardware issue at first and got a replacement). A reboot makes the problem go away for a little while, but it always comes back. I've tried booting into safe mode to prevent IRQ conflicts, but to no avail. Bottom line is that right now it doesn't work on Verizon for all people as a phone, so I'd look at something else till the issues are fixed. It's a relatively new phone, so maybe that will happen."
"April 8, 2017",4,Great phone overall but...,"It does of course have it weaknesses. The biggest one I believe is the screen. It isn't the brightest, while the colors seemed pretty good. They were also quite muted and dull. Also it isn't the brightest screen. The cellular reception is great but WiFi reception is not the greatest but not the worst. The battery is amazing and the speed of the UI is great. Definitely better than the Axon 7 mini and even the Honor 8. Especially since it works on all carriers and even has T-Mobile WiFi calling out of the box! Great phone but has weaknesses like all."
"April 4, 2017",4,Moto continues to shine with the G5 Plus,"I think Moto has hit it stride with offering cost effective unlocked phones. They can't compete with the likes of Samsung or Apple anymore when it comes to features integration and marketing. What they're doing right is offering the G series and the G5 Plus is a fantastic phone for $300. 

The phone snappy and does exactly what I want it to do, the screen is still a tad darker than what I'd like, I've been spoiled with Samsungs AMOLED. That doesn't take away from doing any tasking, gaming, or streaming. 

Jumping back and forth between apps, including YouTube and Twitch, I never ran into any bogging down. And as a mechanic who might randomly need to use the flashlight, having the Moto gestures in place with this phone is a pleasant welcome. By simply shaking the phone twice you can turn on the flashlight or flicking your wrist twice- the camera comes up. You don't have to wrestle with the screen if you're wearing work gloves

The camera is decent, it's not great, you'll find the auto focus isn't quick enough and there's a lot of blur if you move. However it's better than any phone within its price range. 

It still used micro USB for charging and syncing. While we all have dozens of these cables in a drawer, it's time they commit 100% to USB Type-C. It's faster, more reliable and future proof.

I expected the screen and camera to function for a $300 phone but because it's still using a micro, it's getting a 4/5."
"November 4, 2017",4,A 5 star phone that's been crippled to a 4.,"For what you get this is an amazing phone - at less than half the price of flagship phones you get 90% of the speed, screen, ram, and memory expandability. However A FEW FEATURES HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED AND THAT'S UNDERREPORTED AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THEM - the features are actually there they have just been deactivated and I hate when manufacturers and providers actually put the cost into the device and then just turn it off. Moto did two ""no-no's"" and my carrier AT&T;'s is responsible for one. You should know about them because they could be deal breakers for you. #1 THERE IS NO WIFI CALLING ON AT&T.; That's it, they claim the device doesn't support it, but that's fake news from what I can tell being that other carriers do have it, but if that's important to you you should check with your carrier - I can only vouch 100% that AT&T; doesn't let this phone on for Wi-Fi calling. #2 There is no notification light.. well there is, but it has been disabled for the notification screen feature. That's nice, but not as easy as just looking at your screen for a blinking light, you actually have to nudge the unit and the screen will briefly turn on to reveal if there are messages. If you root the device I read that it can be turned on, but I haven't done it. #3 No NFC, so if you want to use Android Pay forget it, they mention it somewhere, but I think it mentions mentioning it again - because also from reading, the radio is there, but it has been disabled.

If those aren't deal breakers and you want an awesome phone that looks great in bright light, takes nice pictures, and is fast with plenty of space for your stuff and will get an update to 8 reportedly, then I would buy this unit, just know the shortcomings."
"April 10, 2017",4,Great phone for a lesser price,"I preordered this phone a week ago and so far it works great. It is TMobile LTE compatible. I preordered it because I felt it had great hardware specifications. I was planning on buying the OnePlus 3T phone but it was over my budget. I have been loving this phone so far and donot have complains with it. The screen size is perfect for me. Many people mentioned how they don't love look of the phone, but it seems pretty decent except for the camera bump which I feel is just fine. The one thing that I miss is the quality of the pictures. It does have great specs on the camera, but the actual picture quality is not a 100% natural. I would not call it substandard, but I expected better. I like the front camera though. Overall, I feel its great value for the money and unless you want a phone which takes the very best pictures and videos, the rest of the phone is just a perfect buy if you want to go for an android. It is better than spending double the money on phones with slightly better specs."
"April 7, 2017",5,Pretty good phone,I got this phone a week ago and have not had any problems with it. It is fast with loading and switching between apps. The camera is great too. It works on straight talk with no problem.
"October 14, 2017",1,Significant letdown from the Samsung Note 4,"Cons: 
- No LEDs for notifications (huge downgrade in functionality).
- Sealed battery (so, in about 18 months, it's either visit a repair shop or toss into a landfill).
- Pitiful virtual keyboard (no dedicated number row on first screen)
- No way to toggle between silence, vibrate, and full sound. You have to play games with the volume control rocker to achieve this effect.
- Volume control rocker is located very close to the lock screen button. Whee...what could possibly go wrong with this arrangement?
- Task Manager does not include a ""close all"" button!!!
- Contacts manager does not include a side alphabet index a la the Note 4. Hope you don't have a lot of contacts. Grrrr.
- The display auto dims in low light, which is infuriating. I assume there's a setting to kill this feature, but I'm so tired of fighting this phone....
- Some stupid app rummages thru my pictures every night and shows me a curated collection of same in the morning. When I find which app is doing this I will uninstall/disable it.

Pros:
- Battery life is excellent, which it should be for a new phone. That will change over time, of course.
- App performance is fast and smooth.
- Flashlight ""app"" is native and easily accessible. Nice touch.

Final thoughts. The Note 4 was a joy to use. OTOH, the Moto G5 Plus is a tool that I'll pick up when necessary, but overall, leaves me unenthused and underwhelmed."
"April 14, 2017",5,As Good For A Lot Less,"I dropped my Galaxy S7 Edge that I bought when first released. The deductible to replace it was nearly the cost of this phone. My son has a Motorola Turbo 2 and loves it so I gave this a try.

The Moto 5G Plus performs as well as my S7 Edge did and it didn't come with all of the bloatware. This phone is responsive, has a beautiful screen, and outstanding battery life. I do not play many games on my phones so I can't evaluate its performance in that area, however, using web, email, twitter, ect. it performs very well - no lag - and is easy on the battery. The only thing I miss from the S7 is wireless charging, but I gained an FM radio! I highly recommend the MOTO G5 Plus."
"July 14, 2017",5,Very happy,"It was a big decision for me to switch from being a Samsung phone user to Motorola. But the Samsung price for top of the line is ridiculous. This Motorola G5 plus has been very easy for me to transition to; learning the operating system was not a problem. I love the 64GB storage and look forward to being able to load all the apps i want without worrying about storage issues that I always encountered with my former Samsung 16GB phone. This phone is packed with features and is a good value (for example speed, storage, good camera, external micro SD card storage capacity.). A big plus over Samsung is it does not come preloaded with a lot of nonsense apps you don't want. A minus is the back of the phone is not removable so you cannot replace the battery. &, Thus, inserting the Sim and micro SD card requires a special tool that came in the box with the phone. Don't throw that out, you might miss it in the box. Surely I will lose that tool and be frustrated down the line, but I noticed the salesperson at t mobile has one at the store, so I could get their help, if needed. Another minus is that the speakers aren't very good, so when I have someone on speaker phone I can't hear them well; instead I have to use my earbuds. The earbud jack is standard. The battery life seems extraordinarily good. But a minus is that the charger that came with this phone, which is a super charger, is very cheap quality and doesn't fit into my phone snugly. Our house now has three Motorola phone uses and each one came with a different charger. I am guessing that Motorola switches up who manufactures them and I got the poorest quality version. But, on the positive side, I can use my old Samsung chargers because they are the same size/type as this phone. I love that this phone is unlocked, which gives me the freedom for our household to change carriers if t mobile's service proves disappointing. I had no trouble getting it to work on the t mobile network, they activated it in their store within one minute."
"May 12, 2017",2,"Good, but it is not enough","Cons: it is nothing reliable, WiFi and signal go out/off too often. I bought it for Uber and Lift driving, but the GPS, even with Location on/High accuracy setting, goes down all the time. In addition, Best Buy offers only 15 days return policy, too short to evaluate this kind of device.
Pros: price, touch fingerprint sensor, Android 7.0 with thousand of applications, nice camera ."
"August 24, 2017",4,"Good not great, but good","All around good phone with a few missing features. Fast performance and very smooth. Pictures sub par at best and speaker is weak. Use Bluetooth for that. Speakerphone falls short but regular is fine. No NFC , not a deal breaker but why not have it on US phones? Battery life is good as well."
"July 15, 2017",5,OUTSTANDING!!,"Yes it works on Verizon!! Click settings, click more, click celluar networks, click preferred network type, click LTE\CMDA, back arrow, CDMA subscription, click RUIM\SIM, Back Arrow, click system select, click automatic, back arrow, make sure enhance 4G LTE mode is on. YOU ARE DONE!!!"
"June 2, 2017",3,Well...,"I returned it for the Moto Z Play. I needed a bigger screen, and I couldn't hear people when they called, even though I had volume at max."
"April 16, 2017",5,Great value. Best sub 300 dollar phone out there,"I was surprised at the rich feature set for such an inexpensive phone. 64 gigs storage, 4 gigs ran, octacore processor and unlocked."
"July 24, 2017",4,Comprehensive Phone,"This phone has all the conventional whistles & bells for a price that is far below iPhone and Samsung offerings. The only beef I have is the Power button. I've probably inadvertently turned the phone off 30 times in the week I've had it. The on/off button is located right where you want to put your hand, and too ""soft."" You could probably turn the phone off by blowing on it. Last phone had the button in a similar place but you really had to press it if you wanted to turn off the phone,."
"May 12, 2017",5,Best phone yet!,This is the 2nd official Android phone I've owned and it is a beast! It runs absolutely everything with ease. No stutters or slowdowns and can seamlessly move between apps without waiting. It's got a very loud speaker and extremely high quality camera. First one I've had with 4k and hdr video recording. Also the fingerprint reader works great. A wonderful way to keep my phone secure while just tapping it to unlock it. I recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't want to break their bank. I think it's dumb to spend a lot of money on something you carry in your pocket all day everyday with chances of dropping it or losing it or whatever. Budget phones for the win!
"May 3, 2017",4,Like it alot after the first few days!,"After reading a lot of good reviews all over the internet, I decided to trade in my Iphone 6 plus for this android phone. At the present time I was not interested in spending a ton of money for a new unit. The first time I picked the unit up I was really impressed, it seemed very solid for an inexpensive phone. So far good battery life, decent enough camera and display for a phone in this price range and great specs to boot(got the 4GB/64GB).

On the negative side the speaker/mic is just Ok, and it is a little slick to hold. I'm hoping my case arrives before I break it...:)"
"April 28, 2017",5,Bravo Lenovorola,"This is the best budget phone you can buy, full stop. Battery is fantastic, it's really optimized and is nearly stock Android. Wifi calling and VoLTE on T-Mobile works out of the box. I can't really see why anyone would drop $900 on a phone these days aside from the ooh-ahh factor. The G5+ is extremely capable for 99% of people. Camera sensor is the same Sony that's in the S7 but the Moto software is at fault for below average images."
"April 20, 2017",5,One word - UNLOCKED!,"I was tired of my cell phone plan, but it seemed as though all of the decent phones came with a plan and if not - it was going to cost an arm and a leg, but Motorola has done it right! I got the 64Gb with 4Gb of ROM. So much room and for the price of 299$ it was worth it! I put a 64Gb SD card for excess storage, but I have not even touched it yet. There is so much room and it is fast. Even came with Android 7!"
"April 8, 2017",5,It's a buy!,"Great phone. Nice screen. 4GB RAM handling mulitasking with music stream and browsiing. Smooth transition to this unlocked G5 Plus from my previous 3 year old unlocked G 1st generation. Gets 2 day battery life on a full charge for 2 hours music stream and 2-3 hours browse per day. Turbocharger included: 15-30 minutes would get you through the day, but figure on 75-90 minutes to charge battery from dead to full. 

If you can live without NFC, this is the unlocked phone to buy."
"November 17, 2017",5,"Super fast phone, great connectivity","I went from an iPhone 6 to this. I had thought about migrating to an 8 but the price was absurd. I decided to try this out and couldn't be happier. Originally the apps were keeping me bound to the IOS ecosystem; however, not I see that nearly every app I use is also available on Android so I can port everything over. Faster phone, costs less to purchase with cheap accessories. Great combo!"
"November 9, 2017",5,Amazing value for the money,"as of 11/9/17 the p[hone is all the way down to $225 which is a steal. A 64gig (4gig of ram) smart phone with a premium feel is a steal. There is a newer ""S"" model of this phone but if you are going to get a 64gig g5 Plus stick with this one as it is cheaper and the new camera is not a big improvement (and that is the main change other than slightly bigger screen and a slight design change)."
"October 18, 2017",1,Started off great....,"I liked the phone from the start ""BUT"" after a month my apps started crashing and not opening. Did a full reset, put a few apps back on the phone and have to power cycle to get them to work. Will not play music from my sd Card. If not for this I would have given it a 5 and rated it better than my Galaxy S5."
"June 30, 2017",4,Excellent cell phone for the price,"No NFC or USB-C are the only things keeping this phone from a 5-star rating. Excellent battery life, never heats up, quick and tons of memory. Love the camera and the Moto gestures."
"June 4, 2017",5,Great affordable phone,This is one of the best phones out there right now. The specs are better than most premium and flagship phones. Camera is very good and it feels like a thousand dollar phone. It doesn't have any bloatware and I can even use it with my Project Fi sim card. I don't write reviews but this phone truly impressed me.
"May 6, 2017",5,exceeds all my expectations,"Have used Moto X and most recently LG G4 and was considering upgrading to either a LG G6 or Samsung S8 but i wanted to buy an unlocked phone that works with any carrier. The price and features of this phone won me over. After using it for a month, I can say It is wonderful in every aspect. Calls are great. Speakerphone is better than my G4. Love the front firing speaker! It is snappy and faster than my old G4. Camera is excellent. Battery may not be on par with the Moto Z Play (nothing else is) but it greatly outlasts my old G4 and is even better than my brother's S8. I use it heavily, with hours of phone calls, hundreds of texts, several videos, lots of web searches, GPS apps, and I almost never go to bed with less than 50% battery left! Screen is bright. I thought i would miss a bigger screen but I do not. It is just the right size. I hate gray but i love the look of this phone. People say the chrome beveled edges look cheap but i disagree. It is wonderful to hold. Some say it is slick (and it is) but I have gotten used to it and now feel very secure - never drop it. Love the dark glass look of the menus. LOVE THE ONE BUTTON NAV. Reminds me of how i used my old Palm Pre. Best phone experience since my Palm Pre 3! Again, exceeds my expectations."
"May 5, 2017",5,Hello Moto,"I needed a good phone, unlocked, CMDA 4g compatible, with low bloatware, low cost, hot spot ready. To my pleasant surprise this fill the bill. Dropped my sim into the phone and it was up and running on Verizon network. After connecting, I was very happy Verizon did not force any apps onto the phone. Its heavily loaded Google apps with a few Moto apps. Beyond that it is clean. Google does force auto updates for their apps only on you. No way I've found to turn this off. Takes great pictures, phone quality very clear. It is difficult to read in bright sunlight. My typical day is 4-6 hours of music streaming, 2-3 hours of hot spotting, lots of surfing, numerous texts, reading news, etc. To my surprise the battery still has averaged 51% battery power left after 17 hours of use, so it will go at least 24 - 30 hours without charging. All this without having to turn on its battery management feature. There was a wall charger, sim card remover, short USB cable for use with the charger, and one quick user guide in the box. If your looking for the same thing I was, this is an excellent choice."
"April 19, 2017",5,This phone is amazing!!!,"For a cheap budget phone, I have to say that the Motorola G5 Plus is, by far, the best choice for somebody wanting a GOOD phone for a fraction of the cost. I am a Cricket Wireless customer and I took the SIM card out of my old phone I was using on Cricket and placed it into my Moto after starting it up. My service transferred automatically with no problems. I was getting LTE speeds, the reception was exactly somewhat better in certain areas than on my old phone, and the Android 7.0 operating system is lightning fast. The 4gb of RAM definitely help that speed along, as well. I have so much fun with this phone. I totally missed having an android, as my old phone was a Windows phone. There are a lot of little bells and whistles with this phone as well. If you are considering this phone, and you are not sure yet, take the plunge like I did and just buy it. You will NOT be disappointed."
"April 8, 2017",5,Excellent,Purchased the 64GB model on launch day to replace a Moto X Pure Edition. Besides lacking NFC the G5 Plus is an excellent value for the money. Battery life is great lasting an entire day with heavy use. The 4GB RAM coupled with the Snapdragon 625 is quick and I haven't had a single issue with force closes or slow downs. My only complaint centers around camera quality under low light.
"November 28, 2017",5,Great phone for $$,"Battery life is excellent, lasting 2 days with moderate use. Screen is bright and readable in sunlight. 64g storage leaves plenty of room for apps. Processor speed is fast. Phone was easy to setup and was ready to go in a few minutes."
"November 27, 2017",5,Great android phone,This is a great phone for the price. I opted for the 64 GB of storage and 4 gigs of RAM. It is fast and has great battery life. The camera is good but not great. I was surfing the internet and watched 2 netflix show and still had 50% battery life at the end of the day. that is impressive. I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for a great budget phone.
"November 21, 2017",5,Few days in I love it.,"I've only had the phone two days but I'm loving it. It's fast and responsive. Being a former Galaxy S6 user, the Moto G5+ works pretty much the same way so no big learning curve. It's also the first time I've bought an unlocked phone. I like that it comes with the FM radio chip and hotspot app, two things that weren't allowed on my Verizon phone. I've read unlocked phones don't contain the bloatware that phone companies load on. I've also read Moto phones use a stripped down version of Android that is leaner and meaner. All I can say is I can see the speed at which this phone does tasks, so much faster. I have the 64GB/4GB RAM model."
"November 20, 2017",5,Perfect,Nice phone//////////////////////////////////////////
"November 20, 2017",5,Great phone at a great price,We have had our phones for two weeks now. Very satisfied. They perform as we expected as well as the size is great. So glad we got the 64GB with 4GB ram. Speed is awesome!
"November 19, 2017",5,Great phone for cheap,This phone is really good. It has a really nice camera and with the memory I can store so much in it. Its not slow at all and at a great price.
"November 19, 2017",5,Stellar Device,"Motorola does it again!

This is a fantastic device, and a big step up from the Moto G4 plus. I have used this phone with AT&T;, verizon, and T-Mobile and this device works well on all 3 carriers. Unfortunately Verizon and AT&T; block this phone from utilizing both wifi calling and VoLTE. T-Mobile does not, both of those features work great on T-Mobile.

Pros:
- Inexpensive
- Reliable
- Quick
- Carrier agnostic
- Qualcomm quick charger included.

Cons:
- The single front facing speaker isn't great and is on the quiet side.
- poor low light camera performance.

Final Thoughts:
This phone is truly the budget king. If you are looking to spend $300 on a phone, that you can use on any Carrier you want. This is the phone to get.

The only thing customers that should be hesitant are those that play very graphically intensive games, and someone who is looking for a stellar camera."
"November 18, 2017",4,Great phone with great features and easy to use,I had another MOTOROLA phone that needed more memory. & this was priced good & easy to use.
"November 18, 2017",4,Best phone under $300,Nice phone. Works as advertised. Like it better than my Samsung S3
"November 18, 2017",5,Awesome phone for a small price tag,This Moto G5Plus is one of the best phones I have ever had. I love the Octa-core processor and 4 gigs of ram. It hooked up to Boost Mobile just fine. The TurboPower charger is awesome! it will charge the phone to 100% in under an hour in most cases. I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat. Camera is crystal clear. I have no issues or negative things to say about it.
"November 18, 2017",5,Great backup to my iPhone,Great fast phone and great Black Friday pricing from Best Buy. I like this much better than the other more clogged with extensions Android I bought (Alcatel) last year.
"November 18, 2017",5,"Fast, right size, right price","About four weeks ago, after researching budget phones, I bought the MOTO G5 plus 5th generation with 64 GB for my wife and, based on her experience, one for me a few days ago. The G5 feels solid, is fast, and does not have bloatware. The camera is very good and the battery charges quickly. Does everything a much higher price phone does and it does it well."
"November 18, 2017",5,nice phone,Nice phone with great features. The screen is large. Love it.
"November 17, 2017",4,Great phone for the Price,"This is 64 GB / 4 GB RAM phone. For the price this is a great phone.
Pluses:
Expandable storage
Good camera/Video
Negative:
Need cover as phone looks very fragile"
"November 17, 2017",5,Great phone for daily use,I heard it did not come loaded with extra apps that you never use. Not complicated to learn to use. Good battery life so far.
"November 17, 2017",4,Great camera,I love this phone. Takes great pictures which is a plus because of my kids.
"November 17, 2017",5,Best phone I have purchased,"This phone is truly amazing, very fast and I'm so glad I caught it on a black Friday sale. The screen resolution is very sharp, high quality. I also appreciate the memory capacity. I highly recommend this phone."
"November 17, 2017",5,"Good bye Samsung, hello Moto",I used Samsung before and switched to moto because the price is better with the features. This was a great change and liking the moto design/experience.
"November 6, 2017",5,Great Mid Range Phone...No regrets.,"I like this phone. Replaced a 23 month old (pure) android device that died with boot loop issue. 
Battery life is 3X better - usually reports 2 days remaining. 
Usually can't tell the difference on speed.
Build quality and feel is on par with more expensive device.

The only negative is it lacks NFC and does not use usb 'C' cable."
"November 1, 2017",5,"Great phone, reasonable price.","Prices of smart phones have gotten out of hand.All providers are trying to rope you into more monthly payments. This was my first unlocked phone, I'll never go back. The G5 Plus 64 GB has the latest in capabilities at more reasonable price. I can't see what more you would need to do at 3 - 4 time the cost."
"October 30, 2017",4,"Great for the price, very good overall.","I am a bit torn as to if I should rate this phone based as a budget smartphone or a smartphone overall. I decided to do a bit of a mix, hence the 4 star review. 

I'll cut to the chase: This phone is outstanding for the price. I purchased the 64 GB / 4 GB RAM version, and it was well worth the price of admission. I came from the Galaxy S6 active on at&t;, and love how speedy this phone is compared to the 2 year-old flagship. Expandable storage is another huge plus -- added a 64 microSD card and have plenty of room for my entire music collection. Phone is speedy and stock Android is (mostly) preferable to any skinned version of Android on an LG or Samsung. 

Battery life is good. My needs aren't your needs, but I've yet to not make it through a full day of moderate-to-heavy use.

What are the compromises? I won't go into the build -- metal back but sides are plastic -- because I recommend getting a case for the phone anyway, considering how the camera module sticks out, and a good TPU case makes it flush with the rest of the body. Even NFC, which I thought I'd hate not having isn't a huge deal. I had Apple Pay on an iPhone SE for a month or so and the speed of the transactions was not any faster, that I could tell, than using a credit card with a chip.

No, the only major compromise is the camera. It is basically on par with the old Galaxy S4 camera, though the S4 has a slightly faster shutter speed, which makes capturing low-light shots a bit easier. But the images are less grainy on the g5 plus compared to the dinosaur S4.

Performance is really solid on t his phone. App crashes are minimal, and everything just works. I find the 5.2 inch screen to be a good size; 5.5 would be too large for me to use on a daily basis. The primary competitor of this phone is probably the moto g5s plus, around $50 more. Is it worth the upgrade to the Special Edition? I don't think so. First of all, larger screen + same battery size = decrease in battery life. Secondly, all of the camera comparison tests I've seen between the two phones indicate that the more expensive phone is actually worse in low-light performance. The cheaper moto g5 plus captures faster too, which is great for me as I have 2 young children who like to move fast. 

Being unlocked is a big plus, too. We've been on AT&T; for years, but if our budget changes, it is nice to know I can take the phone over to T-Mobile or metro pcs with no fuss or muss. 

Temper your expectations. When you purchase the moto g5 plus, you aren't getting a Galaxy S8. or the S7. or the iPhone 8. What you are getting is a phone that blaze through most tasks, without being tied down to ANY single carrier, at a very affordable price. 

For a more in-depth review, please watch the review from Mr.Mobile on YouTube. Michael knows what he's talking about. Good stuff."
"October 27, 2017",3,one problem sound jack,had problem with sound jack nor working right.. at first it worked and in two days didn't. RRU
"October 22, 2017",5,Moto G Plus (5th Gen) 4G LTE with 64GB Memory,"Bought this to replace Samsung Galaxy S5 with 16GB memory. Needed to upgrade because S5 kept running out of internal memory & I kept having to delete apps. I usually buy a new, but not current model phone on eBay, but looked around first. I am very happy with my Moto purchase. It is as close to stock Android as you can get without buying a Google phone; it runs Android 7 (Nougat) with a promise that it will be updated to Oreo; it has a fingerprint sensor that actually works, and it has excellent wifi and is fast. The only thing it doesn't have is NFC, which was not a big deal for me. It has an excellent screen, but not the super resolution of the $700 phones. It is 1920x1080, which is fine. It also has 4GB RAM. I thought I would miss my Samsung, but I don't. The Moto is an excellent phone and an amzing buy for under $300. I bought from Best Buy rather than Amazon in case Amazon preloads its own apps. I haven't shot any video yet, but still photos are okay for what they are - smart phone photos that you can capture because you always have your phone with you. I have only had the phone for 2 weeks, so I cannot comment on reliability. So far, I am very happy with my purchase."
"October 16, 2017",4,Nice phone with some quirks,"So far a decent phone that doesn't have all of the bloatware that most phones have from the factory. No Uber,yp or other things that you have to remove or uninstall/disable to free up space. Phone operates flawless on most apps. I do notice on some apps I have to restart phone to totally close app(might be app alone). 
This has plenty of ram(4gb) which is why I chose it so your not always suffering from a very slow phone. 
The 5.2"" screen is big enough to see what you need. Although the 5gs has a 5.5"" screen. This phone is water resistant & has more ram. I do wish it had ""NFC"" but not on the US model. 
I have checked on Moto's site about the 8.0 Oreo upgrade & says must wait for the carrier to send out. Well this is an unlocked phone & with that you can go to any carrier you want. But with the prepaid carrier you may never get the newest""OS"". Moto should have it available for you on their website.
But you do have 7.0 or more to start with. That's better than the big 3 from the start! Most of their non flagship phones are still running 4.4,5.1, or 6.0 os."
"October 14, 2017",5,Good phone,This is a good phone for the price. Would recommend.
"October 14, 2017",5,Great Phone,Works great have had no problems at all. Would buy again !!
"October 13, 2017",5,Great battery great storage and ram. Great price.,Great battery. Great storage at 64 gigabites. Great ram. Great service and price at Bestbuy. First time buying an unlocked phone. Love it.
"September 25, 2017",5,Good phone.,Really good phone with what a person needs and not the high end in price.
"September 22, 2017",1,Multiple Serious Problems.,"I was looking forward to using this phone- having 64 internal gigs of memory at such a low price is a nice bonus. However, the phone had multiple serious issues that forced me to have to return it. 
I could never get it to Connect to the Bluetooth in my 2008 Jeep's stock head unit (UConnect). I have used about a dozen different phones with the unit since owning the vehicle, yet this one just refused to work with it. It would always pair, but never connect.
The worst problem was the constant crashing. It felt like every time I turned around to try to do something with the phone, it was recovering from a crash, and re-initiating. I couldn't believe how frequently this thing had to re-boot. It was truly shell-shocked. 
Thanks to Best Buy's stellar customer support, I was able to return the product, and choose another device without all of these issues. Thank you Best Buy!!"
"September 17, 2017",1,1/2 star would best describe phone,Slow phone. Bluetooth always disconnecting. Some issues with Wi-Fi. Frustrating and returned. Wouldn't recommend.
"September 15, 2017",5,Good phone,"Without experience regarding newer phones I can only compare it to my old iPhone 4S. I like the large, crisp display, the quick and precise fingerprint reader, long battery life and its ease of use."
"September 15, 2017",5,Excellent mid-range phone,"I upgraded to this from a Galaxy S5. This phone blows that one out of the water in most ways (granted it is three years newer). It does have a lower megapixel count for the back facing camera and is only microUSB 2.0, but otherwise it was an incredible upgrade. Nice and light and not too big."
"September 15, 2017",5,Great phone!,I love Motorola phones! Lots of bells and whistles and looks good too. Very fast. Love the fingerprint unlock.
"September 15, 2017",4,Great upgrade from moto x,Rated 4 stars mostly bc don't like ringers. Love the circle that shows battery level and the new fingerprint button.
"September 15, 2017",5,Best smartphone now for the money,"I have had this phone for several weeks, and I think it is excellent. Similar specs to the Galaxy S8 for less than half the price. With iPhones starting at $1k now, you'd be a fool to purchase the flagship phones when one like this one goes for < $300."
"September 15, 2017",4,Good budget phone,"Nice phone, charge fast, good budget phone with fully loaded."
"September 15, 2017",5,very good phone with this price,"Excellent Phone
very good performance !!!!
Apart from not having NFC, I don't see any negative point ftom last 3 weeks"
"September 15, 2017",5,Very good,"This product is very good, price worth , Best Buy service is also good."
"September 15, 2017",5,Value for money,"Value for money. Great phone, great camera, good features"
"September 15, 2017",5,Value for money phone Moto G5Plus.,"For$260, you will get a flagship phone feel with this Moto G5 Plus. Snapdragon 625, 4GB RAM, 64GB ROM, Camerars are best, fingerprint reader and etc.,."
"September 15, 2017",4,very good budget phone,Runs on pure android and very unique features. love the phone
"September 15, 2017",5,Very Good,Can not be compared with elite Samsung products. But very good one for the price.
"September 15, 2017",5,Value for money,"A great cell phone, which is a bang for the buck. The functionalities are cool and close to flagship."
"September 15, 2017",5,Good phone for the price.,"This phone is good, and cheap. I got it to replace my old phone after the charging port blew, and it replaced that phone fast. The phone does what it is supposed to, and I continued my life with minimal disruptions."
"September 15, 2017",5,Nice phone at an attractive price.,"This is one of the best values in smartphones. It does what I want it to do, and then some."
"September 15, 2017",5,Great Mid-tier Phone,"I upgraded from a Moto G2 and the difference is like night and day. The upgrade in storage and RAM makes it so I haven't noticed any sort of performance issues. The fingerprint sensor is a nice touch, making it easy to pick up and use the phone with one hand. My old phone had stereo speakers, but having calls on speaker phone or playing music sounds just as good to me. I also like the feel of the phone, it just feels like a quality product. 

If you're looking for a good smartphone that won't break the bank, this one is sure to please."
"September 15, 2017",4,Great sound on calls,"Great camera, very good sound. I'm overall very happy with my purchase!!!"
"September 11, 2017",4,Solid Phone,"This a a solid phone, great battery, great signal, i was using a Samsung Galaxy S6, but it died and I had to replace it, the G5 has a pure Android and it lacks lots of features as in the S6 has."
"September 10, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,"This phone seems to be very well built and comes with android nougat. It offers more than enough features and power for daily web browsing, gaming, and texting/messaging/calling/etc."
"September 10, 2017",5,Excellent first smart phone that works in the UK!,"For my first smart phone I did extensive research and decided on this model based on many, many reviews. I found a sale here for $239 for the 64mb model and took the plunge. So far I love the phone! First off, it's a great phone - call quality is excellent. As for the ""smart"" features - I'm still learning but love it so far. The camera quality is great. Apps are easy to load and use. I have ""butt dialed"" a few times with the phone in my pocket and don't know how that happened but will find out some day. Importantly, I immediately took this to the UK and it worked perfectly there (T-Mobile user). There are not too many case and screen protector options at BB or any brick and mortar stores, but plenty on Amazon or EBay. I would make this purchase again."
"September 10, 2017",4,Good,"Has taken a bit to get set up along with a trip to the provider since Best Buy didn't know how to help, but the phone seems OK for now"
"September 9, 2017",5,Full featured phone for reasonable price,Got this phone after reading a lot on reviews on different tech sites. I was not disappointed. The phone is aesthetically pleasing and sports all the desirable features that one would look for in todays phone. The only feature that was missing is NFC which I don't really care so much for since this phone happens to be a backup phone for me. Make sure you go for the 4GB RAM - 64 GB storage model since it will make your investment future proof for some time at least. The fingerprint scanner is fantastic and far more responsive that some other phones I have used.
"September 9, 2017",5,What a great little phone,At age 78 this is my first smartphone. So I checked out many phones on the internet and this one was the right one for me. BestBuy was the only store in town that had the Moto G5 Plus and It has opened a whole new world to me. I got a prepaid plan with 2 GB and now I can call all my kids and grandkids anytime. I downloaded the manual on the G5 to my tablet and am learning more every day. Great little phone.
"September 9, 2017",5,Lot of bang for the buck,Can't understand why anyone would want to spend $600 plus for a cell phone when this Moto G5 Plus can do it all for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend it.
"September 8, 2017",5,As good as any other advertised smart phone.,"I purchased this phone after I returned the Samsung S8. The S8 seemed too fragile and to busy for me and did not care for the price of it. The Moto GS5 is more affordable and can do just about any thing the G8 can do, just operates different. I'm impressed with the performance of the phone, easy to navigate, quality camera, and large storage space. I would recommend this phone to anyone."
"September 8, 2017",5,BUY THIS PHONE!,"So I am going from an old Galaxy 4 - which only gave me a half day of battery life a day. I've been holding on to it not wanting to spend the $ on a new phone but it kept going black on me, etc. After reading about this unlocked Motorola I decided I had nothing to lose. I AM SO HAPPY I DID! I just needed a phone for calls, checking email, surfing internet - I'm older and not obsessed with snap chatting or anything. This phone is fantastic. I go all day and still have another day of battery life left. The phone was so easy to figure out. I love the thumbprint touch to log in, I love just a gentle swipe right or left on the bottom button to get me where I need to go. Setting up the phone was completely intuitive - I figured out most everything. I went to my carrier to transfer my text messages and contacts off my phone. They were all freaking out over my Motorola - this is really cool. I luv not having all the bloat apps which I never used stuck on my phone. I can't believe this was under $300. I am very happy with reception/calling/volume. It's been a couple of weeks and I have no problems thus far. Would highly recommend."
"September 8, 2017",5,Nice Phone,"Nice Phone, wait for a sale at best buy though, the screen is bright and the battery lasts me all day"
"September 8, 2017",5,great mid range phone,dont care for the ui very much but it has been dependable and stable.
"September 8, 2017",5,Versatile Unlocked Phone,It suits my needs as I travel and this phone works on just about every carrier everywhere. It's fast and I prefer a smaller phone that you can also hold on to without inadvertently touching the screen. Plenty of storage as well.
"September 8, 2017",5,Awesome Phone!,Awesome Phone! Clean Android without any bloatware and amazing battery life. I would buy again if mine was lost or stolen. Switched to this from an iPhone 6 with no regrets.
"September 8, 2017",5,Awesome,"Great phone at a great price. Fluid UI, snappy performance, great screen. Love the fingerprint sensor too, first phone I've owned with one. Admittedly, I love Moto devices and have had 3 prior to this( Moto X 2013, Pure edition, and a Moto G 3rd gen). Honestly, this is the best of the bunch. Not a huge phablrt, but still large enough to use for content. Very happy with the camera too. Takes great shots. Can't go wrong with this one."
"September 8, 2017",5,Great Android budget Phone,"The thing that makes the Motorola Moto G5 Plus the best budget phone on the planet is that, for the most part, it doesn't feel like one at all. It looks, feels and operates like a much pricier phone, which means that wallet-watchers are getting a great deal for $299"
"September 8, 2017",4,great performance,"great performance , resolution , I like this model"
"September 8, 2017",3,Mostly good phone Speaker SUCKS!,"The reviews I read for this phone were true to form, however for me, the speaker was a deal breaker. It was by far the worst in my many cell phone history. That said, the Moto G series seems like good phones if you are on a budget."
"September 8, 2017",5,Sturdy and speedy little phone,"I watched and read a lot reviews before I purchased the phone. All of them pointed to this being the best phone under 300, and they were right. Great finger print reader. Opens everything quickly. Good camera."
"September 5, 2017",5,Simple and Gets the job done,The phone is simple and gets the job done. It doesn't have the best quality camera but good enough to take a quick photo if needed. The phone also doesn't have bloatware which for me is a huge plus.
"September 5, 2017",5,Great phone,Wonderful phone. Very responsive. No problem so far.
"September 5, 2017",4,A nice surprise,"I have been a Samsung Galaxy user ever since I got my first smart phone 10 years ago and that was what I wanted for my new one as well, a Galaxy 8 or the new Note. My wife could not justify paying $800-$900 for a new phone and gave me a budget of $300. I spent weeks scouring Best Buy, Verizon and Amazon for the right fit with my preferences of a faster processer and larger internal memory. I finally started browsing the open box items here on Best Buy's site and stumbled across this Moto G5 plus for $299. This had 64G of memory (first qualification) and processing speed that made my Galaxy 5 seem like a turtle. It was also an unlocked phone which meant I could take it to any carrier I wanted (as long as the carrier could use their sim card in my phone). The only con I had was the directions included about adding a memory card and sim card were just picture drawings and not very helpful for my simple mind. I ended up going to you tube and found a video of how easy it was to add my sim and memory card. Happy days are here. The phone just blew away anything I have ever had."
"September 4, 2017",5,"Excellent phone, great battery","I'm impressed with the Motorola G5+. It is thin and light, the gold color is very rich looking, the battery lasts a long time, and it is easy to use. It is versatile since you can use it with all cell companies. I transferred my information from an older Motorola E in minutes, dropped in a Tracfone sim and with in minutes everything was working."
"September 4, 2017",4,Great mid-range phine,This is a great mid-range phone. My wife and I dont need the excessive apps and bloat-ware common with those flagship phones. This phone does exactly what we need to do at half the cost of those flagship phones.
"September 4, 2017",5,Best Phone,Best Phone for the price - great options - love it!!
"September 3, 2017",5,Great Phone,Excellent cell phone for less than half what the provider for cell service asked. I am recommending this type of phone to all my friends.
"September 3, 2017",5,The best mid range phone,"I bought these to replace my kids aging M8 phones and these phones are way better! 

They love the fingerprint sensor and now no longer worry about their siblings finding out their pin or pattern password.

The screen is super sharp, the phone is fast, my only gripe would be I wish the speaker was louder."
"September 3, 2017",5,great phone for the money,"I like the fact that it has more memory, it was a great buy for the money."
"September 3, 2017",5,Loved that I was able to buy it unlocked.,"Great phone, easy to use and no unwanted apps!!! Great camera and love all the different added features."
"September 2, 2017",4,Budget Samsung 8,It does the job and has virtually the same features as the Samsung 8.
"September 2, 2017",4,Bang for buck,"Overall a good product, don't expect too much. It is unquestionably a good product to run your daily needs"
"September 1, 2017",5,Dream phone,"Excellent choice for unlocked phone. This budget phone has feature very comparative to top brand phones $600 and up. Good battery life. Clear voice and had never had a problem loosing connection, including Wi-Fi. Recommend this phone for prepaid services."
"September 1, 2017",5,Fantastic value for money,"I am a Motorola fan due to the fact they ship a vanilla Android OS phone. And Moto G series is an affordable range and the new Moto G5 plus seemed to be a good choice that fits my budget. The phone has great battery backup, good screen, decent camera, decent touch response. I like the fact that it comes with the fingerprint sensor, and there is an option that you can set which makes the finger print sensor perform additional actions - swipe left, swipe right, short hold, long hold for back, recent apps, lock/unlock , google now respectively. I like this the best as it helps me fully utilize the screen as additional onscreen buttons are not needed for functions."
"September 1, 2017",4,Good performance for a cheap unlocked phone.,Good specs and performance for the price. Sd card slot is a big plus but no nfc.
"September 1, 2017",3,Good unlocked phone,I am recommending this phone if you looking for unlocked
"September 1, 2017",4,great phone,get everything you need from an high end phone at a lowend price. love this phone.
"September 1, 2017",4,The best in near stock Android,"For the price, this is an unbeatable value. The camera is as good as the flagship phones of a couple years ago and the finger print scanner controls are a great novelty. The phone runs very smoothly. My only quibble is that conveniences that are generally added into stock Android after the fact by manufacturers are missing such as the ability to set custom ringtones for specific callers."
"September 1, 2017",5,Wife got 128gb iPhone 7..I got,"I upgraded from an iPhone 5c 8GB to this Moto G plus 5 phone.... Seems well made/ works well, I find answering the phone a bit challenging/ but I am getting used to it. Very nice screen and camera / and I like that the bar code and QR code reader is already built into the camera app/ used that on the second day! Easy! And of course price! (Another 60 off on the day I bought it)"
"September 1, 2017",4,"So far, so good.","I have only had the phone for 1 week today. Why would anyone pay 2-3X more for a Samsung S8 or iPhone7? Haven't had issues with the camera image quality, like some have mentioned. It seems a bit heavy, but I have nothing really to compare it to. Just having to ""find"" things all over, even though I had a Samsung (difference in Android revision?). Easily transferred contacts with a downloaded utility. Paid $249 for the loaded version."
"September 1, 2017",4,Nice for da price,"Solid phone with enough punch, and a price that doesn't break the bank. Go with the 64/4gb."
"August 10, 2017",2,"Poor Camera, but great phone!","This phone is great except for the camera shutter speed. It would take great photos but, only if you or the object were still, which usually isnt the case. Its very snappy responsive device, works great for my social media needs! The adroid skin is simple which I like a lot."
"August 6, 2017",2,Not recommended,"This is my second Moto G phone, and it started working really well, stock android is awesome and features are awesome for the price. My issue is that after two months of usage, I've started noticing issues with Wi-Fi connectivity, not everywhere, but I've seen on forums it's a recurrent issue with this phone, I would guess it's a software problem"
"August 2, 2017",5,"Excellent Phone, Good Value","There is a lot to like about this phone. 
 
First is the size. Larger is better for reading and typing but to big and it is hard to hold and to put in a pocket. This is a good compromise at 5.2 inches. I can hold it with one hand and it slips into a pant pocket. Any larger and it would be to much. The display is IPS and is easy to read. Small text is nice and sharp. 
 
It moves right on along which very few pauses. It will sometimes hang few a couple of seconds when using voice for texts but that is about it. It goes through app updates faster than a Google Nexus 7 Ver. 2 tablet that I have. It almost keeps up with me when I review and select from the update list. 
 
It is near pure Android so that means it does not have all the bloat ware and other unwanted apps found on some of the phones. Only a Google phone would be better for those looking for the per Android experience, but this comes close enough and is hundreds of dollars cheaper. 
 
Build quality seems very good. I have had it over a month and no signs of problems. 
 
Negatives are few. It is missing a proximity transmitter receiver and it does not have barometer. The screen can be a little hard to read in a bright sun but I am not sure how that compares to other phones. They may be about the same. It is much improved with a little shade. The location of the power button is such that I would sometimes turn it off when not intended. That was greatly reduced after getting an Incipio case from Best Buy. It is a little pricey at twenty bucks but I really like it and think it was worth it. The other accessory I have is a tempered glass screen protector from from Super Shieldz. I got 99% of it to stick except for one very small part in the upper right corner, but it is not a problem. . 
 
How does it work as a phone? Just fine. Voice quality seems fine both talking and hearing. I can hear just fine if the incoming call quality is good. If the incoming quality is bad, well, then that is not the fault of this phone. The reception range seems average, nothing exceptional but nothing bad. The GPS appears to be quick to lock onto signals compared to some others that I had, but older technology. 
 
I am happy with the phone, would buy it again and have recommended it to others."
"July 28, 2017",4,good phone,"its a good phone. fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate, screen is responsive, etc. there are a few minor settings that dont work terribly well: the adaptive brightness keeps turning off, battery saver randomly turns on when phone is 80-90% charged. and there are a few things about the moto software that i am not keen about, and disappointed that i will need to go to the trouble of rooting it to change. otherwise, very happy with purchase."
"July 24, 2017",5,"Excellent battery life, robust",The battery charges fast and phone has lots of storage. Camera is adequate in bright light and reasonable in low light. Only drawback is that the camera protrudes in the back and the glass tends to get scratched if you place it on a table. But that can be prevented by getting a phone case. Outside of that it is the best phone in its price range.
"July 24, 2017",5,Economical replacement for Samsung Note 4,"Bought this to update for 3 year old Samsung Note 4 after AT&T; (and everyone) ditched their 2 year contracts with free/subsidized phones. This was the first Moto G5 Plus we've purchased (we bought 2 - 64GB models and 2 - 32 GB models). The camera is great, battery life is terrific (though not replaceable) and the phone accepts microSD cards for cheap memory expansion. Snappy performance from the fingerprint scanner...my family is very pleased with our Moto G5 Plus phones and they work great with our new carrier, Cricket!"
"July 19, 2017",2,Very Disappointed so far!,"To date I have problems with Bluetooth connections in vehicles - my old Samsung hooked up automatically in my truck over and over, Moto G won't do that! The Moto G won't download pictures sent in text messages! It just grinds away saying ""Downloading"" but nothing appears! It doesn't like Messenger but keeps wanting to use its Messages app! I like to use my smartphone for online orders, and have not had good success using PayPal with this phone. It seems like it doesn't interface data with Paypal... ! Have ended up with some duplicate orders (never happened with my Samsung)! One other minor point, my hearing aid manufacturer came out with an app to control my hearing aids with a smartphone! This worked seamlessly with my Samsung, won't work at all with the Moto G! Spent an hour with dealer's hearing aid tech on phone with hearing aid app specialist and found the Moto G phone doesn't provide the high frequency signals the hearing aids work on! So considering all these things, I have just talked myself into ordering a new phone from a service provider now that they are selling them! That will give me one place to go for phone and service provider support issues!"
"June 30, 2017",4,One of the best budget phones,This phone has some of the best specs for a budget phone.
"June 30, 2017",5,Super Cell phone,The phone has met my lofty expectations. It just does ever thing easily and without intruding. It is easy to set up. The camera is far better than I expected. I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone.
"June 30, 2017",5,Great phone only with the exception of the camera,"Using the Qualcomm 625 processor from last year, the Moto G5 Plus (4gb RAM / 64gb ROM) is an outstanding value fro the money. I can easily recommend it over anything else in the segment. Coming from a Nexus 6 the user interface is close to stock Android 7.0, with only a few USEFUL additions. The camera is this phone's main shortcoming with heavy handed over sharpening and quick max out ISO."
"June 28, 2017",5,No compromise unlocked phone,"If you are looking for an AWESOME phone without having to pay out the nose the MOTO G5 Plus is the answer. I purchased the 64MB version because it offered the 4GB of RAM that makes it a little speedier to all of my ridiculous requests. I had a MOTO G4 Plus that I loved however it met an untimely demise that facilitated the need for a new phone. I considered getting another G4 since I loved it so much but thought that since the G5 had been released I go with that instead. Even though it cost a little bit more it was worth it. The G5 is a little peppier than the G4 (and I thought that the G4 was pretty good!) and Motorola didn't load bloatware on it. The only thing I was a little disappointed about is that the screen size is a schoonch bit smaller on the G5 at 5.2"" vs the G4 which was 5.5"". I don't know why they went smaller but they did. It's not a huge issue for me but I am curious why Motorola did that. The G5 will not disappoint and is every bit as good as the higher end Samsung models. The only thing you'll compromise when buying a MOTO G5 is the price. You get so much more for so much less. As for battery life, I'm on social media quite a bit due to volunteer work I do and so my screen is on a lot and I use a lot of data. Even with that, I can go all day on one charge."
"June 22, 2017",5,"Good phone, nice features","I needed a new phone for work and spent a lot of time researching low-, mid-, and high-end phones. The Moto G is a definite upgrade from my Sony Xperia Z1, which I had for several years. I needed a phone that could run my productivity apps with ease, and the Moto G does that. The pictures are nicethe zoom is certainly better!though there is slight distortion toward the edges. The camera is easily accessible and responsive, which is a big plus when you need a quick picture. I was able to get some landscape shots from the opposite side of the car as we drove through Wyoming on a family road trip, and the pics came out much better than my Sony's photos in a similar setup. The phone gets a little warm but doesn't get hot like the Sony, and the battery life is a huge improvement. Even with heavy use on the trip, I didn't need to charge t until close to the end of the day, and that was with the phone's GPS running most of the time and apps active. It's also my first phone with a fingerprint reader, and it seems to work well, though almost too well at times! Three weeks in, and I'm pretty pleased with this purchase."
"June 20, 2017",5,Great phone at a fair price,"Very capable device, Most pleasing to me is the speed at which it opens web pages. I knew when I saw this this phone I had to buy it. It has 64 m.b. memory built in and a slot for additional storage. The representative at Best Buy was able to cut my old sim card and then do a data transfer to this phone for free. I've had the phone for two months and really like it. If I had to find a negative feature it would be that there is no visual indication on the screen of new texts and indivdual texts can't be deleted without deleteing the whole conversation, not a big deal. Camera works well. It does what I need it to do and I beieve that I wont have to upgrade again for quite a while."
"June 7, 2017",2,Poor Camera,"Phone functionality itself was decent, with some lagging based on its RAM, but the camera....that's a deal breaker. Low light or, more specific, ballet recital, lighting provides abysmal pictures. For a ""dual lens"" 12MP camera, this does not work well."
"June 3, 2017",5,Great smartphone without breaking the bank!,"The storage capacity on my older entry level smartphone was all but used up, it was time for something with more capability & capacity. I did a lot of research and found this one of few that would work on Verizon without a long term agreement. I purchased the 64Gb version, no more issues with too little storage space! Great camera, great performance, great purchase! Very satisfied, would recommend to anyone that (like me) just can't fathom shelling out $500 - $700 for a TELEPHONE ! ! ! Highly recommended !"
"June 3, 2017",5,"Before buying a cell phone,always check the specs!","Before buying a cell phone,always check the specs! Look at your cell phone like a computer first , then phone! Like the Moto G5 Plus, it has an 8 core processor & 4GB of Ram! Not bad for a phone, Runs faster than a lot of laptops I've seen out there! It also has the ""NOUGAT"" OS, This is the latest operating system for Android!!! I can continue with Moto G5 Plus Awesome Specs....but I'm not..... You will just have to go to your Local Bestbuy store, or to there website and check it out for yourself! I highly recommend this item......P.S. I forgot to mention,...... The price can't be beat!"
"May 30, 2017",5,"Great phone, awesome value.","Great value. The phone is plenty fast, fingerprint sensor works fast, one button navigation is actually very useful, great build quality, feels solid, great battery life and storage, with even more with expandable micro sd card slot. Almost stock Android. Camera could be better, not bad, but my Galaxy S5 camera was better. Very happy with purchase."
"May 28, 2017",4,Awesome phone for the money,"I've had this phone a little over a month and wow! The battery life is INSANE. The battery really does last all day. Yesterday I left to go to work around 8:00 am, and by the time I went to bed around 2:00 am (18 hours later) I still had around 25% battery left! And that's with me running my work email, normal email, phone calls, Facebook, Tumblr, Pokemon Go and a few other apps running throughout the day. I almost never get any latency while running multiple apps and the display is very bright. It's so bright I actually have to run the display at 25% brightness.
My only downside to this phone is that the camera is not good. It's hard to get a decent photo with it, and the resolution is average on the display. Other than that, I would absolutely recommend it due to its battery life, user friendliness, and the Moto features (they're really handy!)."
"May 26, 2017",5,Excellent device for a reasonable price!,"I picked up this phone as a backup phone to my google pixel and never thought I'd be as impressed with it as I am. For under $300 you get a fantastic near stock android experience with a great camera to boot. The phone runs buttery smooth and definitely performs better than expected for the price range. The absence of OIS on the rear camera is a bummer as well as the lack of NFC but it's definitely something I can overlook because of how wonderfully it performs. Hopefully Motorola/Lenova can figure out how to properly issue updates in a timely matter but that's to be seen in due time. I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great phone period, regardless of price range."
"May 23, 2017",5,awesome product!,"I Love this phone. It's good. It doesn't heat up! Good battery, and wonderful design. Durable too, it does not crack easily like many other smartphones. Nice camera too; especially when you are outdoor."
"May 18, 2017",4,Good for a replacement phone.,"Moto 5G plus right now has to be the best budget phone in the $200-$350 range. With the 12MP camera, 4Gb Ram, 64Gb of storage and the carrier support from all four major and prepaid networks. The thing that surprised me was how snappy the almost stock Android UI is. But for the downside to this phone since it's a budget phone. The screen isn't that great in outdoor lighting and really hard to see, the camera seems to be good except for the white balance being off a bit, and lastly the Android updates take forever from the phone manufacturers."
"May 12, 2017",4,Best!,One of the best phone I had so far! But only problem is I am not able to cast from my phone to my TV. I tried every possible way and it still doesn't work for me!
"May 7, 2017",3,Good phone,Bought this phone for a friend. The phone has a nice slick looking body. The graphics look pretty good and camera is another story. That's the set back on the phone. But everything else is fine
"May 5, 2017",5,"tremendous value  excellent camera, great phone","excellent camera, great phone. This would be a good phone at any price, but At its very low price it is an unbeatable value. Highly recommended."
"May 5, 2017",5,Great Phone and Value,"I replaced this phone from the Sony Experia XA Ultra, and while the display and camera were top notch, this Moto G5 Plus is a clear winner. 

This is for the 64gb memory with 4gb ram Moto G5 Plus, and I am overly very impressed with it. 

Fast charging, great camera, and a ton of storage and Android 7.0 out of the box, I couldn't ask for anything else at this price point. 

This is a must have!"
"May 5, 2017",5,Moto G Plus (5th Gen) great mid priced phone,This phone is so much faster than my old motorola droid.The ac wifi works great and most the time when at home it uses wifi calling so uses less data time.This is one off the best performing phones around for the money.
"April 28, 2017",5,Solid phone overall 64g /4g RAM,"Overall very pleased with the Moto G5 Plus. Very crisp response, fingerprint sensor works quickly, and camera is very good under most conditions. Really excels in bright conditions but like most phones it can struggle in lower light conditions. Battery lasts a very long time for me, like ~4 days, but I'm not a power user.

I upgraded from an original Moto X and feel this is a huge upgrade."
"April 28, 2017",5,Great phone for a great price,"The Moto G5 is a great phone for the price. Now is it as good as the top of the line phones? No. But it is less than half the price and for me, it does everything I need. The fingerprint scanner works well, and I really like that. The display is better than I expected. It runs a fairly straightforward version of Android. It is fast and very rarely lags. And battery lasts more than 1 day with some pretty heavy use, while the turbocharger works really well. The only thing that I am not thrilled with is the volume level, but that isn't the end of the world. Great phone, great price. Exceeded my expectations."
"April 28, 2017",5,Great phone for basic use,I ordered the moto G5 plus when it came out I was shocked on how responsive the phone is it's fast battery life is great. The only issue that I'm having is that the speaker phone is not loud . I have read some online reviews that its not compatible with Verizon well it is I had no issue connecting it all I did is insert my Sim card and it worked so far I'm happy with it.
"April 28, 2017",5,Very good phone for the price,At this price i don't think you can beat it. Camera works well. I really like the large memory and speed. Over all a great phone. The case works well too.
"April 21, 2017",5,LOVE IT!,"This phone is REALLY good on battery, and the cameras are great. Galaxy S7 type of photos and video! Get this phone, and save lots of money!"
"April 3, 2017",5,Excellent Phone love it - Way to go Moto,"I began reading reviews over a month ago and could not wait to get one of these phones. I ordered 2 one for me and one for my wife. She wanted the Gold color so hers is on the way.

Setup was easy the biggest issue was needed a nano sim instead of the micro on my Nexus. 

Run great on T-Mobile. Google backup from old phone restored no issues. Setup all my apps fine. We purchased the 64 gig model and ordered some clear cases online. 

The manufacturing looks great very sleek nice phone feels great in the hand. The almost stock Android was a selling feature and the great price. 

This phone is much faster than my Nexus. Camara is much better. Video playback has been smooth. Calls are clear. Wifi works great does not drain the battery like my old phone. The battery is amazing all day on one charge no problem. Forgot to charge over night very little battery drain even with apps running.

Not a power user but all the apps I use work great, Cello Tuner, Dish Anywhere, Netflix, Amazon Music, Mario Run etc.

Definitely, work the money. Bought with Best Buy so I could purchase their Geek Squad insurance so I can have any repairs if needed, done locally, and not mailing in for a 5 day turn around. 

I would definitely recommend this phone to others."
"April 2, 2017",5,Great price,I bought this phone for a replacement on Verizon it works great with no issues all I did is swap out the simcard on my phones the screen is clear and the phone is durable. I bought this phone on best buy I was happy when I received the phone a day early.
"December 8, 2017",5,Best bargain for high performance,"For under $300, the features and performance of this phone still rivals the quality of the newer $800 to $1000 models. Considering most people change their phones every 1 to 3 years, this was a steal..!"
"December 8, 2017",5,One of the best unlocked phone!,"Pro
Like there is no bloatware on it at all.
Really fast and responsive to touch.
Features like shake to turn on flashlight.
Con
Only con I can think of is I have the find a good media player app because play music doesn't play all formats and there no video player on it but I still see it as a Pro."
"December 8, 2017",4,Price and service good,I bought a Moto 5g with 4 g ram and 64 g memory. Price was good and set up service excellent.
"December 8, 2017",4,Great phone by many measures,"This phone is responsive and very capable by any measure. I have had issues with texting that's making me a little crazy at the moment, but the hardware is super solid and it does everything I need it to do. I use it for business and personal and it has been great. I run many network troubleshooting apps on it, as well as RDP and telnet clients and it does all those things well. Voice clarity is great, and the flash led is extremely bright for use as a flashlight. The G5 and G5 plus phones are not in any way like Motorola phones of 5 years ago. They are extremely good, especially for the money."
"December 8, 2017",5,Great phone,"Great budget priced phone packed with many mid tier features. Good looking phone, with beautiful screen. Pocket friendly size, snappy fingerprint reader, 2Ghz octacore 625 Snapdragon processor, 4gb ram, 64gb internal memory expandable to 128gb, running Nougat soon to be upgraded to Oreo. Love this phone. Good call quality, GPS works great, Bluetooth is great, great battery life. It was a great purchase. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good phone."
"December 8, 2017",5,Great,Purchased for my son. He had the previous model and wanted to upgrade. He states he really likes this one better.
"December 8, 2017",5,Great phone for the money,Needed unlocked smart phone and this was the best bang for the buck
"December 8, 2017",4,Good low cost cell phone,This is a good very low cost cell phone. Several changes from my Samsung 4 that need getting used to. Some of the older features on my Samsung are not available on the Moto G5 Plus.
"December 8, 2017",5,Love it.,Beautiful phone. Great phone for the price. Specs are similar to phones costing much more.
"December 8, 2017",5,Great phone,I love this phone! It does everything I want it to do and is a great phone for the price. Specs are very close to phones costing much more.
"December 8, 2017",5,Great phone for price,Needed new phone and didn't want to spend $600 or more. Got this for $225 on sale and couldn't be happier.
"December 8, 2017",4,Quite Nice,"Smaller than I assumed it would be, which was a good thing! I didn't want a small tablet sized phone. Love the quality of photos it takes. Only downside so far is the volume while on the phone. It doesn't quite go loud enough for busy places. I find myself needing to put it on speaker, which in some places I can't do."
"December 8, 2017",5,Does the job,"Fast, great battery life. Camera is not up to my old S6, but adequate. Wanted an unlocked phone, and glad I got this one."
"December 8, 2017",5,Excellent phone for transition.,"I looked at lots of unlocked phones and this phone had some of the best reviews. So far, so good. Easy to navigate for a first time smartphone user. Nice size ,fits in palm but you can read it and find it in a purse."
"December 8, 2017",5,Very good price for this phone,"I love this phone, but after buying the phone I found the same one at a different store at a much cheaper price."
"December 8, 2017",4,Good budget phone.,"Overall the the phone is great. Lots of memory. Pretty fast RAM. Camera not to great. But I also haven't used it a lot. I like the Moto gestures and actions. Battery lasts all day with regular use. ( Some YouTube, a little gaming, and just browsing the internet.) I'm on Verizon network. Put in my sim card from my old phone. Working fine no problems."
"December 8, 2017",4,Solid phone,Very good phone for the price range. Fast and reliable.
"December 6, 2017",5,"Fast, simple, sturdy","I have been using Motos since 5 yrs now and this one seems the best so far. It is quite fast, fingerprint reader works fast, can store upto 5 prints. I am satisfied with the photo quality. I don't think one can get a better phone at this price."
"December 6, 2017",5,Great phone,Amazing phone for the price. 100% satisfied with the phone. Absolutely no problems.
"December 6, 2017",5,Awesome product.,"It is really a perfect phone i bought it for my mom she is 58 .Its camera is vibrant and cool she likes to take pictures and video ,it has a good memory and speed.She loves to watch her favorite shows on it as it has very loud and clear voice and a beautiful large colored screen.I love it because she loved it."
"December 5, 2017",4,Moto G5 Plus Review,"This is a great phone for people who don't want to spend $600-$800 on a flagship device, but still want a phone with great specs. This phone is unlocked, so it works with all of the major carriers. The phone doesn't have any of the unnecessary bloatware that comes on carrier devices. It is close to running pure android. It has some useful, but not necessary, ""moto actions"" i.e. making a chopping motion twice to turn on the flashlight. The battery life is amazing; I can easily get a day and a half with heavy usage. In my opinion the only cons are: the camera is decent; it isn't a $600+ phone so not a deal breaker for me. And there isn't a notification led; Motorola does use a moto display feature for notifications, but it isn't as good as having a notification led. I purchased the 4GB/64GB model; the phone is also available in a 2GB/32GB configuration."
"December 5, 2017",4,Nice camera! But Cricket Refill Card defective.,"Think that I'll get used to this phone, but operating system is very google oriented vs. my older Samsung Galaxy's so I'm on learning curve and don't like google email being primary and not being able to manage exchange email in same way. 
I also bought a Cricket SIM and Refill card. Sticker over activation number was so baked on that it ripped off part of code on paper below so I have to go into store to exchange. And I ordered this online so I wouldn't have to brave the holiday shopper filled store!"
"December 4, 2017",5,Great phone with great price,I bought this phone on black Friday. The product is excellent with high configuration with 64 GB internal memory to help install many apps and store data. I am really happy with the product and also customer service while purchasing. Thanks BEST BUY.
"December 4, 2017",5,moto g5 plus,"Great phone for the value and with the black Friday sale made it better. Has 64 gb of storage with 4gb of ram, along with great battery life.
Has a low light mode which works good for taking pictures at night
Cons are finding a case and screen protector for the phone because no one has them in stock on shelves.
Also dont like the way battery isn't easily removable 
Overall happy with my purchase, using boost mobile service on phone"
"December 4, 2017",4,Unlocked 64GB 4GB RAM,Excellent mid range unlocked phone with 64GB and 4GB ram.
"December 4, 2017",4,Moto G 5 plus is worth for money.,Motorola - Moto G Plus (5th Gen) 4G LTE with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Lunar Gray - is worth for money
"December 4, 2017",5,Valuable in terms of price,"Big screen, clean system, fast so far, good camera, 4G and 64G storage. It is very good in terms of this price."
"December 3, 2017",5,Absolutely Outstanding!,"This phone is amazing in every way. No bloat-ware, great fast low-light-capable camera, every radio for all carriers, great screen, great battery that is half full at the end of a day I'm playing with it pretty constantly, fast processor so zero lag on anything, and 4gb-64gb is future-capable so it should last, finally slick beautiful metal case and gorilla glass. A real phone for half the money of flagships with virtually everything they promote without their pretensions. Well done Moto - would buy again in an instant - and I'm telling everyone I know that this is the best deal, best phone for business oriented professionals. Didn't really want the nfc but that's the only thing missing in the package vs. highest-end devices."
"December 3, 2017",5,Loved it,bought it for my little brother. he loved it. i loved the price
"December 3, 2017",4,Nice phone,Nice phone for the price. Got it in thanksgiving deal. Front camera and back camera are awesome.
"December 3, 2017",5,Best phone for the money,"I bought this phone for my wife and she loves this phone. Great camera,
great picture and it's the perfect size."
"December 2, 2017",5,Great Product,A decent product at a reasonable price for good specifications
"December 2, 2017",5,"Great handset, priced right","I never spend a lot on common technology products. Okay, so I have lots of money tied up in DSLR bodies and lenses, but that's a hobby :)

The Moto G5 Plus 64GB is the most I have spent on a phone since I had a bag phone in the 1990s. Having nearly pure stock Nougat baked into the ROM makes the phone a joy to use. I don't game save for logic puzzles, so video viewing is the heaviest use the phone will see. I have viewed full HD video on the phone, and it performs flawlessly. Battery life is far better than any other handset I own save for an old LG unit where the battery takes up nearly the entire back of the phone.

Three updates arrived yesterday(as of posting time stamp) and I hope that the 6 month call errata has been addressed. Still waiting on Oreo. The updates were stability and security issues related.

I'm quite impatient when it comes to tech. products being ready for interaction(I have an i7 6700K PC W/ 1TB SSD) and this little handset does not disappoint. I have paid for perhaps 100 apps, but use only half that many, so I have used hardly any space to this point. I have 48 GB free. I also inserted a 256 GB micro-SD card for audiobooks, pictures and off-line dictionary files. For me, the phone has massive amounts of storage.

In handling, the apps open up quickly, the split screen works as Google intended, and the phone always seems to have extra RAM available for additional tasks should I need to call on them.

Lots of people buy phones for their camera capabilities. I am not one of those people. I have found the camera to be merely capable, rather than stellar. However, there are NO cell phone cameras that I find stellar, so this is not a dig at the phone's capability as a shooter. Its low light deficiencies are real, but lots of users will never notice this. I would expand on this, but far more capable professional reviewers have done so. 

Unknowing friends and family believe my G5 Plus to be a premium phone. I think it is the metal case, fingerprint sensor, fast near-stock Android, and my customizations. For me, the G5 Plus is as premium as I need, and better than expected.

The G5 Plus is a great 'bargain' phone. I'm getting my mom one for the holidays.

I ULed a screenshot of my phone.I use NovaLauncher for lots of reasons, including installing the displayed Funkong Icon package and Wave Live wallpaper."
"December 2, 2017",5,Excellent for the Price,Got for 174.99 on thanks giving deal with cricket sim kit + prepaid card and 4GB/64GB is the best deal on net
"December 2, 2017",5,One of the best budget phones,"It is been a week that I purchased this phone and I am very happy with all its features, if you don't want to spend a lot a money for a high end phone I would recommend this phone, the only difference will be the camera."
"December 2, 2017",5,Incredible power and camera for this price!!!,"Since smart phones have come out, I've been loyal to Samsung - I've had the 2, 4, and 6 - I finally damaged my 6 and at Black Friday I decided to research prices as the days of free top end phones are over - this Moto has more power and a better camera than my 6 - yes I said six, this phone obviously doesn't match up to the newest Iphone or Galaxy, but it is more than most people need - I love it and at $224, the extra money I would have paid for the new Galaxy will pay for over half a year of cell service!!"
"December 2, 2017",5,The best phone if you do not want to spend $$$$,"This is hands down the best phone on a budget, there is nothing the my pixel can do this phone cant do, I have a pixel and got this for my son, my next phone will be this one."
"December 2, 2017",4,pretty happy with phone,"+stock android 7.0
+good battery life
+has the Moto gesture commands
+/- camera is good except in low light conditions
-no Moto voice
-camera sticks out on the back so you pretty much need a case to set the phone down on a hard surface"
"December 2, 2017",5,Great phone,Great phone for the price. Has basically all the features of the much more expensive phones just No bloatware. I switched from Samsung s4 which finally died on me after 4 great years of service.
"December 2, 2017",5,Good phone at a great price.,Has the look and feel of a more expensive phone. I purchased the gold. Very fast response. Takes great pictures. Lots of room for my pictures and apps. Liking it so far.
"December 2, 2017",5,great phone,"bought as a gift , I have one and love it.I have bought one for every family member. I have told all of my friends to buy them one. Two of them bought their phones at best buy in Oxford.

"December 1, 2017",4,Great,Good product with decent processer. I like the camera.
"December 1, 2017",5,Excellent product,"Simply the best-unlocked phone, very smooth and reliable."
"December 1, 2017",5,Good Quality phone,Good phone. Battery power is good. Doesn't get updates right away.
"December 1, 2017",5,Wow what a Great Phone,"so having an i phone for years i needed to get a New one and the whole lease thing thru Sprint urked me, so i looked for used i phones thats were $$$ only to find and buy this Great rated Moto G5 plus phone for $230 this phone is Great the sound is Great too ( not tinny) as people have posted, the Camera is Great ( but doesnt have all the I phone pic functions) but thats not important it still takes Great pics and the screen is big too"
"December 1, 2017",5,Easy to use and lots of memory,I love this cell phone! I love the camera. I love that it has so much memory. I love the turbo charge feature and I love that it is easy to use.
"December 1, 2017",5,Moto G5 plus runs great,If you have a less expensive smartphone from any of the pre-paid companies this is the phone for you. I put my Cricket SIM card into this unlocked Moto G5 plus and it went right onto the Cricket network. It can go on so many carriers networks. It took a while to get used to the ui of a Moto and a new o.s.but I'm not getting any more hangups and freezing that I had with my 16gb phone that had 2gb ram. That phone came from the carrier. It's a very nice phone.
"December 1, 2017",4,A good budget phone,Good phone at an an attractive and affordable price.
"December 1, 2017",5,Great phone for the price.,"I'm very happy with the phone. It is much better than my previous one, and I did not want to spend the big bucks required for the latest greatest ones. My only disappointment is with the app for calling. I cannot see any way to set categories for my contacts (helps when you cannot remember a name, but you know it was a business contact, etc.)"
"December 1, 2017",5,Can't Beat this phone for the money,"Does everything the flagship phones do as far as I know. Octacore processor works fast. I'm a chauffer and subject to losing phones. Got it on sale for $225 plus tax so if I lose it, not as big a deal as the Galaxy 8 I may have bought. Don't miss my S5 one bit. Only complaint is this keyboard could have larger letters. Very happy with my purchase. Plan to use the same logic when I buy a TCL 4k Roku TV instead of the more expensive brands soon."
"December 1, 2017",4,Gets the job done!,"I picked this up since I don't need a new/fancy $700 phone and the recurring monthly lease. It does everything I need, talk/text/data and it's unlocked in case I change carriers. The price even beat out Amazons, as I had a G4 w/ads that died on me previous to this."
"December 1, 2017",5,Much to like about this phone,"I wanted an unlocked phone for my wife that met the following criteria:
New
Will work on Verizon network
Minimum 64gb internal memory
Cheap enough for me to buy without financing
High user reviews
Built by a major phone manufacturer
All specs better than her S5 galaxy

This phone filled the bill. I will give it to her on Christmas"
"December 1, 2017",4,Excellent Razor,"The reviews weren't wrong, only thing I wish the trimmer was a little stronger."
"December 1, 2017",4,Good Phone,Nice phone with optimal pricing. and price is also in range
"December 1, 2017",5,hello motto,great phone for a school kid who is rough on cell phones.
"December 1, 2017",5,4.5 stars,Had a Motorola x pure and changed to this. I am happy with great battery life and quality of calls. I think the camera could be better as it's washed out to some degree. Sounds is also not a good as my pure edition x. I would recommend it though.
"December 1, 2017",5,Best phone for the price,"Works excellent, has great performance, no wireless AC but I don't mind about it. Great Moto"
"December 1, 2017",4,Good Phone,This phone is for my mother in law and it seems easy enough for her to use.
"December 1, 2017",5,Love these phones,"I know most people consider this a cheap budget phone, but they are dead wrong. These phones are awesome."
"December 1, 2017",4,Worth for the price,"I bought this on thanks giving deal and it is best worth for the price
64GB with 8GB RAM and it is good config phone.
The display is not so great , but good."
"December 1, 2017",5,Great unlocked phone,Great powerful unlocked phone. Love this phone works great with Straight Talk.
"December 1, 2017",5,Nice budget phone,"I am using MotoG5plus for a week and so far quite satisfied with its performance. Good appearance, decent camera and responsive fingerprint sensors. Lacks compass sensors. 
Overall good value of money."
"December 1, 2017",5,Best phone for the money,"Had to get a phone due to my previous phone dying from a defect, and most websites recommended this phone as the best bang for the buck. They were all right. It was on sale for 224.99 for the 64GB version, and this is the smoothest and fastest phone I've had in awhile. Zero bloatware, Android 7, metal body. Really feels premium for the price. Only annoying think is the inability to remove the Google search bar from the home page, but a third party launcher app takes care of that."
"December 1, 2017",5,Fast and Easy,I really like the speed! Phone has worked very well for me. The only down side I've noticed is the speaker volume doesn't get very loud.
"December 1, 2017",4,Great phone for the price,"Moto has always amazed me with its phones at the $200-300 price range. G5 plus is again a great phone in this category, probably the best."
"December 1, 2017",4,Love it but,Its missing some feature like FaceTime and other stuffs
"December 1, 2017",5,Great Smart Phone,"Perfect, good performance!! and Excelent Battery!!"
"December 1, 2017",5,Outstanding value - never buy locked phone again,"Stock android 7.0 system which should be upgraded to Oreo. Excellent battery life compared to my Note 4. Nice bright screen. Very fast. Bought 4gb ram version - very pleased with my purchase after 10 days of use. No wi fi calling built into the phone software - but it does work with Google voice and hangouts for wi fi calling. I use this for work so I cannot comment on the camera, although it seems very good for the pictures I've taken using professional mode. Sprint put in the sim card for free - very easy and you are not charged for an ""upgrade"". If you buy a locked phone from a carrier they usually want to charge an ""upgrade fee"" - so this (or any) unlocked phone is the way to go."
"December 1, 2017",4,Ok mid-range phone,"Phone is fast, camera is not the best. 4GB RAM is nice."
"December 1, 2017",5,Great phone,"Sleek good looking phone, worth buying for the money."
"December 1, 2017",4,Great budget phone,Great budget phone. Got latest features. Very popular phone.
"December 1, 2017",5,Everything was great.,"Excellent, the delivery before expected, the product is great"
"December 1, 2017",4,Good Phone with great price,Good Phone with great price. I loved shopping on Best buy.
"December 1, 2017",5,Amazing phone,Raw Android! You gotta own one to understand. Hard to believe the price for what you get.
"December 1, 2017",5,Great phone so far,Have had the phone for a week. Great phone especially at this price point. 64gb memory is great. The iPhone SE I had was terrible so I returned it after one week and waited until I saw this unlocked phone.
"December 1, 2017",4,Good,Moto G plus is very good. I like it. I would recommend this to my friends.
"December 1, 2017",5,The perfect phone!,Quality build. Accepts an sdcard as internal storage. Better screen resolution than iPhone at less than 1/3rd the price. Excellent camera plus tons of other features. Also can always rely on Best Buy for the best price & fine service!
"December 1, 2017",5,Moto/Lenovo is the New Sleeper,"Great phone! From the smooth processor to the user friendly Nougat interface, Moto/Lenovo has made me a believer. I even traded up to the G5s Plus a week later, which gives me the same phone, yet with an almost half inch bigger display. Either model is well engineered and reminiscent of the flip phone days, when Motorola (and Nokia) was the quality standard in cellular devices."
"December 1, 2017",5,Great phone!,Works great! Setting it up was very easy. Love the weight of the phone. The screen size is really nice.
"December 1, 2017",5,Exellant service and product performance,Best service and best product. I purchased this product on black Friday with some great offers and discounts
"December 1, 2017",5,Great Phone!,"Great Phone - and great price! 
Just what I needed!"
"December 1, 2017",5,Awesome and Cheap,In my opinion its a cheaper version of the Samsung Galaxy S8. Just compare the specs. I like it and have yet to have a problem with it.
"November 30, 2017",1,GPS in Google Maps Does Not Work,"Google Maps inconsistently works on this phone. It will not recognize when I am moving, and the blue location icon will change every minute or so. It frequently will not enter into navigation mode and will stay in the ""birds eye view."" Unfortunately, I tried working with the Geek Squad twice, which was not helpful fixing the issue. On my second visit, I was referred to call Motorola. I am now working through Motorola's warranty service on the phone to troubleshoot the issue. One bummer part of this process is that I bought the phone at Best Buy with the hope if there was a problem that I could fix this in person, but I am left dealing with Motorola customer support. Therefore, this is not an incentive to continue purchasing items at Best Buy over another online competitor."
"November 30, 2017",4,Decent phone,"Overall this was a great upgrade from my old phone. The camera is only average, but for the price its acceptable."
"November 28, 2017",5,great phone for the price,"Works perfect at anything, the only ""down"" is that it does not connect to wifi ac 5ghz which I don't care much that's why I still give it 5 stars."
"November 27, 2017",4,Could be better...,Only thing this phone is missing is nfc. Other than that it makes for a solid primary and a great back up phone.
"November 26, 2017",5,Very good phone with fair price,"I purchased this phone for an international trip before bringing it back to the U.S. I owned an iPhone and other Android phones, but this phone is a delight. It is fast and takes amazing pictures."
"November 26, 2017",4,Great buy .. great phone,"Phone is fast, plenty of memory.... display is good....good size... great battery life.....only 4 stars due to speaker is a little weak..."
"November 26, 2017",5,"Fast, reliable phones","I highly recommend Motorola smartphones, this one is great, other ones I've had have been great. LG, Samsung, etc all seem to have more built in programs (bloatware) that give issues with freezing, restarting, etc that Motorola doesn't seem to have!"
"November 26, 2017",5,Great phone for any budget,"Great phone...excellent battery life for an average user, average camera, does great at multi tasking."
"November 26, 2017",5,Good battery life,The only con it has is the speaker. It sucks! You can't hear music or videos that good or even a call when you put it on speaker. But the battery life does make up for it. I can go a full day without charging my phone! Nothing beats that.
"November 25, 2017",3,Cheap phone,Cheap and good android phone. Not a great camera but ok. Wifi calling don't work in absence of cellular signal. So returned it.
"November 25, 2017",5,Excellent phone,"For the price, you can't get better than this phone"
"November 25, 2017",5,Great phone,Lots of storage for apps and photos. Great size. Love it.
"November 25, 2017",4,good ratio price quality,It is an easy to use phone; I purchased it as a backup.
"November 25, 2017",5,So far so good. Still getting used to the phone,I bought this phone due to a recent review I read comparing the more expensive phones currently on the market. This phone was rated at the top so I decided to give it a try. So far so good.
"November 25, 2017",5,great phone,"works great my mom loves it, good camera and easy to use"
"November 25, 2017",4,decent phone,does everything i ask it to. good phone for the money
"November 25, 2017",5,Great phone,I got this phone for my sister and she absolutely loves it. It has great battery life and storage especially for the price. It has better battery life than an iPhone and is much cheaper than one also.
"November 24, 2017",5,Beat budget phone out there,"If you don't want to spend too much on phone and still want most of the features, you've come at the right place. There is no wow factor to this phone, but it will serve all your needs."
"November 24, 2017",4,Hello Moto G5 Plus,Purchased 2 G5 Plus phones after reading reviews on YouTube. So far my wife and I love the phones. They are not too complicated and do just what we need. Plus they were priced just right.
"November 24, 2017",5,Perfect inexpensive phone,Love this phone. Big screen with great resolution. Long battery life. Works fast. Minimal unneeded applications. Good cell service and wifi. Love it.
"November 24, 2017",5,Great budget phone!,Been looking for a budget phone to replace my old phone and found this amazing phone! Had no regrets buying it!
"November 24, 2017",5,Awesome for the Price,Let me start of with I am not one of those that feels compelled to stay up with cutting edge phone technology. when I realized I would finally have to replace my Galaxy S4 I figured I get whichever bare bones phone that would do everything I needed for the least amount of money possible. When I came across the Moto G5 Plus I was fairly surprised at how good the reviews are and how good the specs for this price range. It's such a good deal for what you get one of my buddies picked one up the day after I did.
"November 24, 2017",5,Amazing phone for the price,"quite amazing phone and fast interface, really good price"
"November 24, 2017",5,Gr8 value for money,"Best spec phone for the money. 2.1 octa core, 64 GB ROM, 4GB ram with Oreo update seems too good to pass, along with dust proof and water resistance. Supports all carriers, CDMA to GSM, and can be used for international trips as well."
"November 24, 2017",4,"Best of the mid-range phones, a King has come!","Bought on another e-tailer site on a Black Friday deal. This is the second one I've bought, previous was purchased from a here. I migrated from a Samusung Galaxy S5 on the Verizon network.

Pros:
You're not going to get a better performer at this price point. Long battery life, snappy performance, stock android (no bloatware), and service unlocked (works well on Verizon). 64gb storage to avoid ""forced obsolescence"", 4gb RAM, and an EXCELLENT fingerprint reader, better than the S5 even!. Love the ""Moto Actions"" app that allows the home / fingerprint reader button to act as a ""back"" and ""active apps"" button as well, giving more room on screen for apps by eliminating those from the display. Most Verizon apps still work (Message+, Visual Voicemail), except ""My Verizon"". It works, it just doesn't remember your password like it should, no big deal as you just have to keep entering your password to get your billing/account information (surprisingly, it still accurately shows the data ""odometer"" though). Why would anyone pay $1,000 for a smartphone when I can easily surf the net and make calls just as quick, for less than 1/4 the price. Very few users will EVER use a $1,000 phone to it's full potential. But what exactly is full potential??? We're not launching rockets here. I look down on Apple users that are running ""bleeding edge"" hardware. Then again, I thank those ""first adopters"", they're helping pave the way for more ""cost conservative"" options for the other 98% of us smartphone users.

Cons:
Very very ""slick"", it demands a case of some sort, otherwise, it's gonna slip right out of your hands. Some features not as smooth as Samsung TouchWiz UI. I installed Nova Launcher right out of the box to bring back some of that Samsung ""slickness"". I also didn't like that you didn't get the little red number notifications (officially, ""unread count badges"") on the app icons, so I installed TeslaUnread for Nova Launcher to get that back. I also don't like my notification volume tied to my ringtone volume, a limitation in Android Nougat apparently, and there is NO current workaround except for root maybe (I say ""maybe"" because I'm not willing to root currently, so I haven't looked into it). Native Camera app sucked, used a 3rd party app instead (be sure to deactivate native camera app before installing 3rd party app, otherwise you may suffer a reported glitch. As of this writing (11/24/2017), there's a Facebook crash bug / glitch being reported by many users including myself, although there are some ""workarounds"" that help reduce crashes. Hopefully there will be a fix from either Motorola or Facebook soon (not a deal breaker, but annoying as the app crashes
quite randomly).

Overall:
My Samsung Galaxy S5 was hogtied at just 16gb of storage and then I did all I could do to ""limp it along""...move apps to SD card, adoptive storage, etc. Those tweaks started making that phone quite wonky and it was time to move on. This phone is as responsive as the S5, if not more so, especially once the S5 got to it's maximum storage capacity. Migrating to this phone was only slightly painful as there are several things I liked on the S5 (some sounds even!). There are a few easy ""tweaks"" (Nova Launcher, TeslasUnread, etc) you can do to this phone to get it darn near close to that Samsung TouchWiz UI slickness. I even managed to find and download some Samsung specific notification and alarm sounds that I truly like!! (Don't hate me for the ""whistle text notification"" ;-) Yeah, it's not quite there, but at this price point, I laugh in the face of other ""wireless provider coddled"" phone buyers. You know, the ones that pay upwards of $600, or more, plus tax in most states, over the course of ""interest free"" 24 months just to get a phone that is ""network proper"". I took off one star, which is slightly being nit picky, for the need to tweak this to the ""Samsung experience"", horrible camera app, and the current Facebook glitch. In it's own right, it's a great phone, but if you've come from Samsung you'll be slightly disappointed unless you're willing to tweak the UI as I did. If I could, I would give 4.5 stars."
"November 24, 2017",4,provides good connection,Everything works as it should. Could benefit from a better camera.
"November 24, 2017",2,only suitable to minimal use,Overall I don't feel this phone is nearly as good as it should have been. I am not comparing it to flagship devices either. It locks up routinely and most widgets on the home screen stop working after a period of time. I have to delete the widget and then replace it for me to get it to work again. Most functions that I have had little trouble with on other phones such as using Audible and Google Music etc either fail to start or stop after a number of minutes for no apparent reason. Not a good buy at any price.
"November 24, 2017",5,Good phone for the price,It is a really nice phone with a good camera and at a great price!
"November 24, 2017",5,Great for the price,"Not a flagship device but if you're an Android fan looking for a better-than-barebones inexpensive device that gets all the basics right, this is your best bet."
"November 24, 2017",5,Great Phone,"Tracfone user. Used the cdma sim (Verizon). Easy setup from tracfone website. Smooth Data, app transfer from previous smartphone. Phone clarity is good. Compared to my old moto e it is lightning fast"
"November 24, 2017",5,Fantastic Value,"This phone is a great value in a world where phones are approaching $1000. For the price of one high end phone, you can get this phone for each member of your family, and for 99% of the population, outside of the camera, there will be no appreciable difference in performance between this phone and one that costs a month's rent. 

Pros: Close to stock Android aside from the addition of the very useful Moto Actions. With 64 GB of onboard storage and microSD support, you will rarely be required to manage files on the phone due to insufficient storage. 4 Gb of RAM will let you multitask with a ton of apps without worrying about the phone slowing down. The processor has an incredible compromise between power and energy efficiency; the phone lasts about 9 hours of screen on time with internet browsing on mobile data. The Moto Actions let you use the fingerprint sensor to navigate your phone, freeing up some of the screen space usually dedicated to those buttons. Its loudspeaker is front facing instead of on the bottom or worse, on the back. 

Cons: The screen to body ratio is on the lower side; there are some phones with larger screens with similar body sizes. This phone lacks NFC, which is used for things like Android Pay. The camera is unimpressive."
"November 24, 2017",5,"Great phone, good price","The price ($225) seems to be pretty standard now, but that's OK. It has 64GB of internal memory (I hope it takes me a LONG time to fill that up!), to which I added a 64GB SDcard. Everything (all the features of more expensive phones) seems to be working fine and I'm really glad I bought it."
"November 24, 2017",4,Excellent for the price,Bought 2 for my sister and brother in law they couldn't be more impressed very good phones for the price
"November 24, 2017",4,It works,Got this phone to replace the one I dropped and tried to fix myself. Takes some getting used to. Has very good battery life. Almost 3days without having to recharge it. Lost all my contacts because I didnt back up to the cloud. Service provider was able to load info from several years ago. Live & learn.
"November 24, 2017",4,Good phone for good price,Good phone for good price. My only issue is that I wish it had NFC :(
"November 24, 2017",5,Very happy with this phone,"I usually buy cheapos that were returned or open box. But wanted to upgrade to a better camera and enough memory that my few apps can update seamlessly. 

The screen and photos are beautiful. I especially enjoy the absence of Samsung BLOATWARE. Highly recommend."
"November 24, 2017",4,Normal lg phone,"Nothing super special, but does a good job. The gold color is nice."
"November 24, 2017",4,Nice phone,Good phone for the price. not impressed with the sound.
"November 23, 2017",4,Perfect One,"Worth for money , Good one. Must buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"November 23, 2017",5,Excellent buy for the price,Good phone with excellent camera. Love the pictures taken by this one.
"November 22, 2017",5,Wow great phone; great price,"I was a Samsung user for years and then came this moto. Its got a lot of horsepower and a nice feel in the hand but it felt best against my wallet. Its not a galaxy s8 but its very quick, got a good camera, plenty of storage. For less then half the cost of those flagship devices, I'm super satisfied."
"November 22, 2017",5,it works great,"So far this cell phone works great at this price compared to other brands, when they charging lot more for the same configuration. Moto is great!"
"November 21, 2017",4,Pretty Good,"Its a prety good device, when you get it with the discount its even better. It excels in its function for the price."
"November 21, 2017",5,Best bang for the buck,"The Moto G5 Plus is an great phone at its regular price. When it's on sale, it's exceptional."
"November 21, 2017",5,Great phone,"I bought this phone because I did not want to pay $800-$1000 for a new iPhone. It has a metal body, a big screen, and has a quick response. Compared to my iPhone 6 this thing is blazing fast."
"November 21, 2017",5,Flagship without the cost,I don't understand people that would but a $1000 phone. This does all the things I throw at it. It's like they learned everything good from moto x pure and put it all in this solid device. The only con is the slow updates or I don't expect fast update from motorola but I don't follow too much about what's new anyway.
"November 21, 2017",5,Great phone,Phone has everything all the other phones do for a fraction of the cost.
"November 17, 2017",5,Great Phone,"This phone does it all for half the price of the competition. Battery typically is above 50% at the end of the day, even when used heavily. Screen is great and I love the fingerprint security. I set it up for my thumb and forefinger on each hand so I can turn it on from any position and it works perfectly."
"November 17, 2017",5,Very Pleased with This Unlocked Phone,"I needed this phone because my existing ATT locked Android Moto G was bumping up against very limited storage (16GB) because the Androis OS itself takes up over 10GB and because of ATT crapware. Got this on a great sale and couldn't be happier with it. Picked up a great case at Amazon for 7.99 and the whole unit now feels perfectly balanced and secure. Will be able to load apps galore without fear of hitting a storage limit. Took it into ATT reseller store and they cut my old SIM card down to the required nano size and installed it free of charge. Also transferred all of my apps and data. This very reasonably priced and refined phone, with a fast processor and 4GB RAM, will be a keeper for at least 4 years."
"November 17, 2017",5,Good upgrade,Went from ON 5 T-Mobile to Motorola and loving it!
"November 17, 2017",5,Great phone for the prices,"I bought this phone for my wife. It has great performance, price is awesome, high end features like face recognition."
"November 17, 2017",5,Best camera for it's price,When I shopped for the phone beside iPhone and Samsung I didn't expect that good. When I read the consumer reports I have no doubt. I satisfied than I expected
"November 17, 2017",4,Price right $225 on sale.,Good features for the money. Unlock a big plus..Have not set up for service yet.
"November 17, 2017",5,Best Phone for the price,Great intermediate phone with fast processor and plenty of memory and storage space.
"November 17, 2017",5,Speedy,Great phone so far. Big step up as far as speed from my previous device
"November 17, 2017",4,Great Phone For The Price,"My Moto G 3rd Gen was getting a little old and that battery wasn't holding a charge too well. So I bought this one when it was on sale for the early Black Friday sale and it's been great so far. Very responsive. I can go three days without charging the battery but I'm not a heavy user. The sweet spot for me is a 5"" screen so this is a little bigger than I'd like (5.2"" screen) but it's hard to find a high quality phone with a 5"" screen. The camera protrudes on the back so I picked up a cheap case which helps with that. I really like the Moto brand as the version of Android installed is pretty vanilla and doesn't have a lot of bloatware installed like some of the other phones. And really, for the price it can't be beat."
"November 17, 2017",5,Great Phone,Why spend so much money for a I Phone or the likes this phone does everything for a third of the price
"November 17, 2017",4,Great product for the price,Great product for the price. Haven't really used the phone that much yet.
"November 17, 2017",5,Bought for a gift,I bought this for a gift for my daughter in law and she loves it! So much better deal than buying an IPhone. I think I May be switching to this next time I need a replacement.
"November 17, 2017",5,Excellent phone for that price of below 200,The phone is really great and is above my expectation.
"November 16, 2017",5,Excellent phone,It is just a perfect phone for a very reasonable price.
"November 16, 2017",5,Great Phone,"I purchased this phone primarily because it was unlocked. The 64g was a bonus for the price.
I've had my Moto G5 plus for a year and still Love it. Just purchased my 2nd Moto G5 plus for my 14 year old daughter. 
Great Phone!!"
"November 16, 2017",5,nice phone,"good phone, reliable, have used for a few months. very fast"
"November 16, 2017",5,Excellent phone for that price of below 200,"I am very happy with the Moto G5 Plus 64GB phone. It works faster than my Samsung Note 4 and price is also much below than samsung. You can't really complain anything about the phone, it's really nice atleast till now, hoping it will last work like this for long. I am using it since last couple of weeks and happy about it."
"November 16, 2017",5,Fantastic product,Brought this product as a gift for my brother and this is the longest phone which he has used without breaking
"November 15, 2017",4,Great phone now that Verizon issues fixed,"At first when I got this phone there was an issue with VoLTE on Verizon which made the phone unusable for making calls, and with VoLTE turned off I couldn't use any data services while on a call. Now that Motorola patched the issue and VoLTE can be used for calls this is a great phone. I especially love how the fingerprint reader doubles for navigation (swipe left for back, swipe right for apps view and tap button for home screen). This navigation being enabled removes the google navigation keys from the screen which enlarges the screen area. Also the battery life is great, easily can get through a whole day without charging with moderate use."
"November 15, 2017",5,Amazing for the Price!,Phone is excellent for the price. It is unlocked and compatible with all make networks. Camera takes good pictures and the Moto actions are very helpful. The fingerprint sensor is of high quality and works very well. Call quality is also excellent.
"November 15, 2017",5,Great smartphone,Needed a phone for Argentina and this one is perfect. Fully unlocked. Works great!
"November 15, 2017",5,easy to operate.,I like the screen is bigger and easy to read. Picture come out very clear.
"November 15, 2017",4,"Great phone, long battery life!","Soft touch response on screen, plenty of storage and fast performance."
"November 15, 2017",5,Great touch screen,Smooth and great touch screen. speed is good and easy to use for user.
"November 15, 2017",5,Great phone.,Fantastic phone for the price. Purchased for my father and he loves it. Finally I don't have to hear him complain any longer.
"November 15, 2017",5,Best mid range android phone,"This Moto cell phone for the special Black Friday price is the best IMHO price value cell phone. The features as listed make this a powerhouse of a phone for this price level that in reality can give several higher priced flagship phones a good run for their money.

The phone worked without any problems after setting it up. It updated up to the latest security s/w right from the get go. The display, sound and stock Android with minimum MOTO overlaid, makes it a welcome fresh breeze of air compared to the other carrier built in app phones eating up storage.

Its very fast in games and all app operations I used. 

I especially like the radio that you can listen to via the headset or through its speakers (although you still have to plug in a headset to act as a antenna)

The only minus but not worth taking a star off is that it has no compass.

Overall it met my requirements for what I was looking for in a replacement phone.

Oh yes! it does make and recive phone calls."
"November 15, 2017",5,Great replacement,Used to replace a busted galaxy s7 in a pinch. Much faster and more reliable than I expected.
"November 15, 2017",3,Good phone,This phone is fast but as I have used it now for a week I find peopleI talk to say that I sound muffled. The volume on the phone is just barley enough. The Verizon store times seems to sound garbled. I use a Plantronics ear piece most of the time and it works well. This phone will probley be returned by me. It is a quick internet phone screen is perfect. The flaws tend to make it a deal breaker. The positive is u can use it on any carrier.
"November 15, 2017",4,Great,"Its very good my son love it,its very easy to use."
"November 15, 2017",5,Great Phone & Great Price,"Highly recommend this Moto 5 G Plus. Great Phone and Great Price.
Takes good picture. Compared to Samsung and Apple iPhone . Clarity and Not pixelated. 
Save money with this phone"
"November 15, 2017",5,What a bargain!,This phone does all that my Samsung Galaxy did for 1/4 of the price.
"November 13, 2017",5,Great Unlocked Phone,I purchased this phone when my IPhone stopped working - I did not want to be under a contract & have a monthly payment so I started researching other options. I read the reviews for this phone & it sounded like a great option w/a great price. I have been very pleased with this phone. It does everything my IPhone did w/the exception of Facetime - I downloaded an app & that was quickly remedied! It holds a charge longer then my IPhone did & the charging cable that came with it charges my phone super fast!
"November 13, 2017",5,Excellent phone,Switched from Samsung to Moto GS5 Plus. No performance issues at all. Great phone. Don't be fooled by the price. Every bit as capable. I'm a believer!
"November 12, 2017",5,Nice phone,I am very happy with my phone. Have had the phone for about 6 months. Takes nice pictures. Does everything I want it to do.
"November 12, 2017",5,Cell phone,I really like this phone unfortunately it broke but I had nothing to do with the phone we had more to do with my temper.
"November 10, 2017",5,Great phone for general use,"I am not someone that cannot live without a phone close by, but I like to review my emails and check Facebook while outside my home and this phone provide me with everything I need and more, the cost is also very reasonable compared to other phones, so I am real pleased with it,"
"November 10, 2017",5,Bought for my son,"This phone is an excellent value for an unlocked phone. You can take it to any carrier. It works as good as my Galaxy S8, and has just as much storage. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to untether themselves from a carrier's contracts."
"November 10, 2017",4,Good phone,"I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the name brand phones on the market, I was using a Galaxy S7 so that was the bar I was measuring to. I've been using this phone for a week or so now and have no regrets for changing. Camera is decent, and as far as performance I don't notice anything significant in speed or reliability. I did notice that my previous phone would connect to multiple Bluetooth devices at the same time (nice when driving to have media to the stereo and calls to my headset), this phone is one device at a time."
"November 9, 2017",4,Phone worth for its price,I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now. The battery is really good. On standby it goes for 2 days and camera is also really nice. I spent 275$ for the 64 gb phone and I feel its worth the price.
"November 6, 2017",4,Very nice phone,Great phone at a reasonable price. Would recommend
"November 5, 2017",5,Great budget phone,"Great value for the money and does everything I need well: email, social media, phone calls, GPS and messaging. Camera isn't the best, but for a much cheaper price than any iphone it was worth the compromise."
"November 4, 2017",5,Good phone for the price,"Got this phone for my son. Great for a budget android.

Great features and android 7. It has a newer version of Android than my Samsung S7."
"November 4, 2017",5,A Lot of Phone for the Money,"I've had the Moto G5 Plus for about a week now, and feel I can give it a fair review. I'm coming from an iPhone 6S+, so I'm used to a different OS, as well as ""flagship"" devices. The Moto G5 Plus checks all the boxes for the most important things I want in a phone. The battery life is the best I've had on any phone, the screen looks excellent, the OS is butter smooth, and everything just plain works. Android has come a long way in recent years. The one place the phone is noticeably lacking is the camera. While it is the same sensor as the Galaxy S7, the processing is different and there is no stabilization. The stabilization (or lack thereof) is most noticeable during low light situations. It is extremely difficult to get a clean image, and I consider my hands more steady than average. This can all be overlooked, however, due to the incredible price. $300 for a phone, brand new, that does 95% of everything I did with an $800 phone. Sorry Apple, but I am finally jumping ship, and there isn't all that much that I am missing."
"November 3, 2017",5,Great phone,Does everything I want a phone to do with no problems so far. If anything changes I'll change my review.
"November 2, 2017",4,"Good phone, good price","Got this phone when on sale, and was a great price for a smart phone. Easy to use. But I don't like that it doesn't have a way to take out the battery, in case it needs a hard restart (so far it hasn't). Still, that lack of option makes me nervous. I got the warranty just in case."
"October 30, 2017",4,Good phone for Cricket Wireless,"We wanted a better phone than most of those available directly through Cricket, but we also wanted a good deal. While this phone is not state of the art, it also didn't come with a huge pricetag either."
"October 30, 2017",4,Feels good not to spend over $700,"I have used this phone for over 3 months, I can say I feel really good about my decision to buy this over a $700 phone. This works as well as the other phone. The only issue that I have noticed is that when I go into all apps to clear I see the apps which were running which I never opened. For some reason they pop in background and I am not even aware of it.

Other than that, I am happy with the purchase."
"October 29, 2017",5,Hello Moto!,"This is a great phone at a great sale price - $269.99!
I did my research and the phone lives up to the reviewers accolades. Thank you Best Buy reviewers and the awesome in-store Best Buy staff!"
"October 29, 2017",5,Affordable Phone,Phone does everything great and at an affordable price
"October 28, 2017",5,Great Basic Smartphone,"Good phone size, large storage capacity, long-lasting phone-charge (3 days or so)"
"October 28, 2017",5,I like it,Long battery life good sound on phone and a really good camera.
"October 28, 2017",5,Son loves it,Very nice phone. Works just as well as the ones double the price.
"October 28, 2017",5,excellent phone,"easy to use, camera is very good. the price was reasonable."
"October 27, 2017",4,Best Phone For This Price Most Likely...,"Ok, let me start off by saying something blunt... most of you DO NOT NEED an $800 phone! Phone prices have gone nuts the last couple of years or so. Top-end or ""flagship"" phones are now reaching $1,000 (or more). Are they really worth it for what you get? I say not really.

The Moto G5 plus can do 90% or more of what the flagship phones can do, at literally one-third or one-forth the price. You get a good 5.2"" 1080p screen, a decent mid-range processor that can handle anything except the highest processing games. An improved camera that isn't quite as good as a flagship, but good enough for most folks. Mico SD slot for storage expansion. Fingerprint reader that's FAST, and yep, a becoming extinct headphone jack, too.

If you spend the extra for the $279-$299 model, you get 4 gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage. Worth it to me, but if you're on a tighter budget, the $219 or so model with 2 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of storage still works perfectly fine for all of your day-to-day things. The battery is excellent, and if you're a light user, could get two days out of it.

Two negatives for this price: It does not have ""NFC"" meaning you cannot use the wireless Android or Google pay feature to pay for items at a store. And, Lenovo (who now owns Motorola) has a really bad reputation for updating Android since they took over. The 7.0 version that comes with this will get a couple of security updates, but it's anyone's guess if it will ever be updated to Android 8.0 later. For this price though, it may not matter - you can afford to update to a newer phone in a year.

My main point is this - this is a decent phone and I think it's time the buying public starts rebelling against the big phone makers who keep increasing the price of their flagships. Start using phones like this. Once you get it set up and customized, you'll realize how much money you're saving and letting the phone makers now you refuse to make a mortgage payment just for a phone."
"October 27, 2017",5,Great Phone!,"I had the 32GB G5 Plus since June, and it was a perfectly excellent phone, until I dropped it in the ocean. So, to replace it, I bought another. This time with 64GB/4GB ram. 32GB model was a great phone! This one is even faster! No problems on Verizon. Maybe not for everybody, but for the money, what more can you ask for? Love it!"
"October 27, 2017",4,Great Phone,"I have been really happy so far, and can confirm that a 200GB MicroSD XC Card works in it, not just the 64GB one I bought.
Only Shortcomings are;
Needs a slightly faster GPU, even the Adreno 510 would be perfectly nice and place it closer to the S7 in performance
Not Stereo (all phones should offer stereo speakers for crying out loud!)
No OIS or EIS on Stills just 1080p30fps recording.
Splash resistant (ip52/54 equivalent?) I'd like to see a lot more phones meet ip66 or ip67 ratings"
"October 27, 2017",5,Excellent value.,Great phone for the price. Features and performance are nice.
"October 27, 2017",4,Works for me!,"I needed to upgrade my old HTC, just got tired of fighting the lousy touch screen. My wife uses an Apple I7, but I'm invested in thr Google/Android world. Reviews said the G5 plus a very good mid-range phone and I would say I totally agree.
I am happy with it. I'm an AT&T; customer in a remote location an reception is good.
My biggest complaint is the factory .pdf downloadable manual. It has to have uses, but helping on the G5 plus not one of them, in my opinion. I gave up on it and just google any questions I have. I would buy the G5+ again and Best Buys was smooth and easy to order from."
"October 27, 2017",4,"Nice phone, good camera for the price","had an older Moto G. This one larger, but not huge. Only miss the light led notification on phone.. must activate phone to see missed calls or messages"
"October 27, 2017",4,What I wanted,"Simple, still has some bloat it ware. Need large memory, since I keep phone's along time and operating software only grows."
"October 27, 2017",5,This Phone is All You Need,"I would consider myself a poor tech enthusiast. As such, I like to make sure I get bang for my buck. 

This phone is great. It has excellent speed, plenty of RAM, and lots of internal storage. This actually the first Android phone I've used without a micro SD card, though the option is there if I want it. It's compatible with all four major carriers and MVNOs that run off those carriers. Right now I'm with Total Wireless. Popped my SIM in and had service.

There's also great Dev support, if that's your thing. Root and ROMs abound if you look for it.

If there's one thing I could change about the phone, it would be the screen from LCD to OLED. The screen is great, I just like the advantages of OLED.

Overall, just buy this phone if you want something you can take to any carrier, if you want great performance at a great price, or if you are ballin' on a budget, like me."
"October 27, 2017",5,Great phone,My daughter is very happy with this new smart phone .
"October 26, 2017",5,Awesome Phone for the Price,This is a great phone for the price that works even better than some of the more expensive phones I've had. I had a LG G6 which I loved but needed something with less bells and whistles. I did my research and this was one of the best phones for the price I was looking for and am loving it too!
"October 24, 2017",4,"This Moto Fits me to a T, or should I say G....","Did not need all of the features of some of the newer phones, so opted for an older Moto G5. Read good reviews on it, and so far the fit, feel, and function has been good. Only issue I have is Power button placement, as i hit it daily, putting the 'Power Off' screen up repeatedly...."
"October 22, 2017",4,Good device for good price,Overall a good device. brightness is a little on the lower side when used in bright outdoors. decent camera in lighted environment;not so good in low light. Responsive device due to the 4 GB RAM.
"October 21, 2017",5,Terrific Value,"Great battery life, familiar Moto G features, very likeable size and 64GB at an excellent Best Buy price."
"October 20, 2017",4,Excellent price,So far the only drawback is the cumbersome method of adding ring tones. Battery lasts a long time between charges and sound quality is awesome.
"October 20, 2017",5,very good phone at a reasonable price.,Does everything I need at a good price. Good camera. very responsive
"October 20, 2017",5,Great beginner smart phone,"Got for my son. Great value for smart phone. Does everything he needs a phone to do. Went for highest level of memory, so phone could handle more and not need to be replaced/upgraded as soon."
"October 20, 2017",5,Fast responsive phone with AC WiFi,A clean and uncluttered phone. Fast and responsive. Very clear images on the screen. Takes very good pictures quickly. Flash is progressive. Takes pictures with out flash in low light and produces good results. Still learning how the adaptive home button works.
"October 20, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,"The Motorola G5 Plus has excellent features at a great price. Camera takes great pics and can be accessed by 2 twists of the wrist. No need for a flashlight app installation as it has flashlight that can be accessed by two quick karate chops. Has 64 gig on the phone and ability to add more on SD card. Going from a Samsung Galaxy, the transition is very easy. I love it."
"October 19, 2017",5,great phone for me,bought this to replace an older moto G phone because it had a lot more storage so far haven't had any problems with it bought the unlocked Moto G 5 because I use consumer cellular the phone wouldn't text at first but it was A CARRIER problem so far it has been a great phone takes good pictures it also charges fast
"October 19, 2017",5,Fantastic cellphone,"For the money we spend on cellphones, this is the best value buy far.
It is a quality product with enough features for me. Plenty of memory and storage. I highly recommend."
"October 19, 2017",4,Great inexpensive phone,This phone has a few bells and whistles yet remains simplistic. The camera is amazing!
"October 19, 2017",5,A lot of bang for the buck,"One of the best smartphones out there, especially considering the price. Sure, there are superior phones in the market, but not for this price. Does everything I need from a phone plus some extras too. Highly recommend it."
"October 19, 2017",4,Good phone at a reasonable price,This phone was needed as the last one was busted up. It is a good phone with all smart phone features at an attractive price. I do notice when talking that the mic volume goes on or off depending on where the phone is touched. All else is good.
"October 18, 2017",4,Really good,"Really good phone for the price.
Has most of the top notch technology."
"October 18, 2017",4,Good Phone for the price,Bought as a replacement for my wife. Camera is good and has a decent size display.
"October 18, 2017",4,Good Product,"I like this device. Performance wise, it does a good job."
"October 18, 2017",5,Cheap And Awesome,The phone is really good for its price. It's basically like my Huawei 6P but cheaper.
"October 18, 2017",3,"Nice phone, iffy quality","I had read great reviews of the Moto G 5 Plus and had fantastic results with the previous model so was excited to get this phone. Unfortunately, after two days the phone overheated and never worked again. Best Buy fully replaced the handset and my experience with the replacement has met all expectations."
"October 18, 2017",4,Great value phone.,"Very solid phone for the price. I dropped my old phone and rather than paying tons of money to fix, I opted to purchase this phone. It was easy to switch over my old SIM card on Verizon's network. It lacks the camera quality on my Samsung but otherwise a very reponsive phone. It lower light situations, the camera lacks the capacity to still take vivid pics."
"October 17, 2017",5,Love My Moto,"This is my third Motorola smart phone and each one has improved with features and functionality. While it's a little larger than I wanted, I love the speed and ease of transferring info from one device to another. The camera is great compared to my old Moto G and I would definitely recommend going with as much memory as you can afford to prevent a situation like I had where I basically had a perfectly usable phone but was unable to update it anymore because the memory was all used up."
"October 16, 2017",5,great cellphone for a beginner,"great cellphone for a beginner, great cellphone for a beginner"
"October 16, 2017",4,Great phone for the money...,This is a big upgrade from my Moto E that I bought over a year ago. I love most everything about the phone except the battery drain. I originally installed everything Google that was on my old phone but the battery drain was ridiculous even though I am a VERY light user. I did a factory reset and installed as a NEW phone -- the battery life is better but still not as good as I think it should be. I have other devices running Android Marshmallow -- this is my first Nougat device -- my guess is that Nougat is more of a battery hog. I also had some issues where the phone would not dial out if it was connected OR trying to connect to a WIFI. The reinstall as a NEW phone resolved that.
"October 16, 2017",4,Most storage for your money,I would absolutely recommend this phone. You can't get 64 Gigs for under 300 from any other manufacturer.
"October 16, 2017",5,Motorola - Moto G Plus (5th Gen),Motorola - Moto G Plus (5th Gen) is nice product . I like it.
"October 15, 2017",4,"Nice budget smartphone, but wifi calling issues","I have been using this phone for a 3 months now. what I most like about the phone is it is stock android without the skins that the various carriers and manufacturers add to the phone. I first activated it on the Verizon network, and had no calling issues . Interestingly, I have read reviews that this phone had voice quality issues, but I had none while on the Verizon network. When I switched to T mobile however, initially I had no problems, but after about 3 weeks, the phone started dropping calls. One day, it dropped every call that I made or received. This prompted me to call t mobile customer service tech support. I was initially told that because it was not a t mobile branded phone, that is why I had issues with wifi calling. I told him it did not start out that way, I had no issues with wifi calling to begin with, and this phone is unlocked for all carriers, and I had no problem on the Verizon network. He said he tweaked some settings and sent out another signal, and then called me back, and the call dropped while talking to him. Service did get better after that, and my son's Samsung s8 unlocked does not have issues with wifi calls dropping on his phone. This is what I figured out with this phone ( or at least my phone). It does not transition well between wifi and cellular calls, so when that transition has to be made, it drops the call. This has only happened at home, and only on wifi calling. All the other phones on my account have no problems, 2 are t mobile phones, and the other 3 are not. I have no problems with VolTE calls. the phone is otherwise phenomenal, it is super fast, and is not cluttered with apps the carrier adds which are usually of no use to me. However, since we buy a cell phone to act as a phone I have to give it 4 stars. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars, with no reservations."
"October 14, 2017",5,Moto G5 Plus great phone for the budget minded.,"The Moto G5 Plus is a great phone for the budget minded. I was considering a Samsung Galaxy S8 until I saw the CNET review. THe ratings between the phones was almost identical and a $250.00 or more price difference. CNET did not disappoint. Great phone with a great camera and really nice HD.
My only complaint ( and it's minor ) the phone is too sleek for me. Since I tend to drop things, a $5.00 case solved the problem.
If you buy this phone you won't be disappointed."
"October 13, 2017",5,Really am liking the phone,I was a little concerned but have found it very easy to navigate. The apps are accessed and operate smoothly and efficiently. Great phone.
"October 13, 2017",4,Great budget smart phone,"Owned for a few weeks now- replaced a broken Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. I have nothing but good things to say about this g5. My one and only wish is that it had inherant video calling capability, but that's a small wish overall. I will never go back to buying the overpriced samsung phones after owning one of these."
"October 13, 2017",5,Excellent,The g5 is an awesome phone within this prince range and good deal from Best Buy too.. thank you Best Buy :-)
"October 13, 2017",5,Better than I expected.,"Have yet to find anything negative. Camera is outstanding compared to previous phones I've had, which was a big plus for me. If I had to nitpick, it would be that battery charge percentage is not displayed on the home screen....or maybe I haven't found out how to get it there yet."
"October 13, 2017",5,Best on a budget,"After extensive research I chose the Moto 5G Plus. Without a doubt this is the phone to choose if you're trying to stick to a tight budget. There are two versions; either 3/4GB of ram and 32/62GB of storage. 

Both are quality phones with good processors and GPUs. The Moto 5G Plus is not a top tier phone but it will get you an experience that is smooth and packed full of convenient features."
"October 12, 2017",5,Wonderful phone for the price,"I was in the market for a new phone, and preferred not to spend $800 or more getting one of the newer fancier models. I don't take a lot of photos, so I just wanted something with a powerful processor and a good amount of memory. This phone delivers that in spades, and the camera isn't terrible either. I use this phone mainly for texting/apps, and have had it for two weeks now with zero issues. It doesn't have NFC, but I never used that feature anyway. For this price I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a powerful unlocked phone at an affordable price."
"October 9, 2017",5,Excellent Phone at this price,"Awesome phone suits my demand, will recommend to everyone"
"October 8, 2017",4,Good phone at great price,I replaced my far more expensive Samsung with this very functional moderately priced phone.
"October 8, 2017",5,Nice phone for the money!,"Battery life is great
Little to no bloatware
Good moderate size screen. Not too small, not too big
Bright!
Fast with 4GB Ram version. 2GB version is acceptable, but slower. I've had both, returned the 2GB for the 4GB.
Wish it had USB-C"
"October 8, 2017",4,Good phone,"impressive battery life. message notification is very useful, you can review the message without unlocking the phone."
"October 7, 2017",4,"Good phone, low speaker",Overall this phone has been working out great. It can run all my apps and the fingerprint scanner is pretty cool. Minor drawback is that the speaker isn't that loud. I recently moved and use Google maps on my phone to survive :p. With the sounds of the road alone the phone can be hard to hear.
"October 7, 2017",5,Great value,"I love this phone. It's atock Android with no bloatware. It is fast and powerful, with a decent camera. Recommended."
"October 7, 2017",5,Great Phone,The phone does everything I want plus gets much better cell phone and data connection than any other phone I have had. Being out in a rural community has meant my reception has been spotty at best. But with this phone I am able to connect any time.
"October 7, 2017",4,Good camera and battery,"Friendly keyboard, excellent camera, battery charge fast"
"October 6, 2017",4,Very good,I really like my new cell phone still learning all about it
"October 6, 2017",4,Great Unlocked Phone,"If you're into unlocked phones reasonably priced, this is a steal! RAM and storage are top notch and the price is affordable. No major annoying flaws after a week of use. Great little phone!"
"October 6, 2017",5,Great Phone,This is a great medium range phone that feels like a hight end phone I highly recommend.
"October 2, 2017",4,Time Will Tell,"Like any thing new, time will tell as to the performance and quality of this device . Cost was low...I refuse to pay $$$ for something whose life span is 2 to 4 years at best ."
"October 2, 2017",5,Great phone!,This phone was everything we expected. Great memory space and great price!
"October 1, 2017",4,"Great canera, batery last longer","Great product
Perfecto size 
Good looking unir
Have all you need and more"
"October 1, 2017",5,Great phone for the money,I am happy with everything about this phone. It work's good with straight talk.
"September 30, 2017",4,Fast Phone...,"Bought this to replace my oneplus one. Battery wasn't holding a charge for more than 3 hours. Getting 3 days out of a charge with the Moto G5 Plus. Great phone with a great price....even at $299.99 it's a great deal. Goes on sale often, pick it up ! You won't be disappointed."
"September 30, 2017",5,Great Phone,Ditched high dollar Samsung. Love it! Hello Moto!!
"September 30, 2017",5,Great phone!,"This phone is overall phantastic. 
There is not one negative thing to say. The camera takes amazing pictures, I love it!"
"September 30, 2017",4,Great Budget Phone,"After 1 month of use, phone is still in great shape. This is a great budget phone and you can't expect much more of a phone that is less than $400. If you are into taking pictures especially at night, this phone isn't right for you as camera shots at night are not clear and detailed."
"September 29, 2017",5,"What a BARGAIN for the price, but I miss NFC","The phone is fast, responsive, feels great in the hand, has a premium look and feel, and has plenty of storage. What more could you ask for?! Well, I would ask for NFC since that makes phone setup so much easier, not to mention how much I'm going to miss being able to use Android Pay for more than a card storage app. However, I still think this phone deserves the high rating because you are not going to have everything packed into such an inexpensive but glorious package. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to drop a small fortune on a new smartphone."
"September 29, 2017",4,Budget phone with performance,"It is smooth and fast when opening apps, easy to browse online, takes good pictures, has most of the functions as those on more expensive phones."
"September 29, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,This is another great Motorola phone that can be used on ALL carriers as it is unlocked and contains all the bands necessary.
"September 29, 2017",5,Phone not as we seem it to be,It looks awsome. The camera and all the features are cool. It hasn't even got hanged and all my friends love it.
"September 29, 2017",4,Great value,"I've only had mine for about a month, so I'm still in the breaking in..figuring it all out. This is my 1st unlocked phone and I was afraid that it would be too different. I do like not having all the bloat that comes loaded on the phones from the carriers. 
I do tend to use my phones pretty heavy and was hoping that the battery would get me further, but knowing that the battery is larger than most others, I'm guess I'm quite happy. 
It's a pretty great phone, overall, and not crazy expensive."
"September 29, 2017",4,Great phone. No need to pay for a flagship phone,"Pros: clear screen with accurate colors, close to stock Android experience with useful Motorola features layered in. Fast and accurate fingerprint reader, expandable memory, good sound quality. Plenty of RAM ( I got the 64GB version with 4GB of RAM). Light weight. FANTASTIC battery life! I go all day with fairly high use and don't have to charge it until I go to bed at night.
Camera has good feature set.
Con: camera is a bit slow, no NFC. Lack of accessories available but did find a good case from Spigen."
"September 29, 2017",5,Excellent phone,"This is a very fast, well loaded phone at an exceptional price. Battery life is great and screen resolution also great. Awaiting upgrade to Android 8 but 7 is working well for now."
"September 29, 2017",5,"Great Device, easy to setup, fast","Great Device for a great price, easy to setup, bloatware was min. Great Unlocked device, powerful quadcore processor. Dual SIM is a nice extra"
"September 29, 2017",5,Nice,I like the phone and camera. I had an older model And was familiar with it's use. I would recommend it to others.
"September 28, 2017",5,Good unlocked phone,I had the Moto G4 Play 4th generation and I needed to replace my phone so I looked around and went with the 5th Gen Moto G after my research. I ended up getting the 64GB Model with 4GB of RAM since I think phones these days need at least 3GB of RAM. It's fairly user friendly without all the bloatware and runs Android 7.0 and no problems yet. I would recommend checking this phone out if you are in the market for an unlocked GSM phone.
"September 28, 2017",5,Nice phone,Very good phone under $300. Nice screen and plenty of great features.
"September 25, 2017",5,MOTO 5G NEW PHONE,FIRST OFF TYLER OUR SALES REP WAS BEYOND OUTSTANDING. WE WANTED A VERIZON COMPATIBLE ANDROID WITHOUT DEALING WITH A NEW CONTRACT AND THEIR SALES HYPE. STILL VERIZON WAS NO HELP ON SERVICE FOR AN HOUR TO DO THE DEVICE SWAP ON OUR SERVICE PLAN. WHY WE DID NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM. HE STAYED CALM AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF WORKING ON SUCH ISSUES HE GOT OUR ACCOUNT WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE. WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK FOR HIM TO BE MY SALES REP AGAIN FOR FUTURE PURCHASES. THE PHONE IS REALLY COOL. I LIKE ANDROID AND WILL NOT BY APPLE ANYTHING.
"September 24, 2017",4,Good for the price,Does a lot for what it costs and it's battery life is very good.
"September 23, 2017",5,Love this!,Great quality. Lightweight. Fast! Looks beautiful and bought it on sale.
"September 23, 2017",5,Best cheap phone on the market,"I needed a new phone asap after my old HTC M8 got soaked. This one fit the bill for what I wanted in a new phone and what I was willing to pay. It performs absolutely great for the price, has tons of memory, and has the expandable SD slot. Would recommend to anyone wanting a high performance phone for relatively cheap."
"September 23, 2017",5,Excelent,Grate product. Good relationship between price and product
"September 23, 2017",5,I love this phone,I had a galaxy s7before I had this amazing Moto!! I love how fast it operates not as much be on any other place have a good one.
"September 22, 2017",4,"Good case, but lacks style","This case gives this device a much needed holdability aspect and lends nice weight with just the right amount of bulkiness to feel secure carrying the phone around, even in slightly ""dangerous for digital devices"" scenarios such as doing yard work, or deep cleaning the garage.
Looks a bit off from the back though, can't put my finger on what it is, the design bugs me for some reason."
"September 22, 2017",5,Fast processor! Great screen!,I love this phone. Great price. Fast speed. Good camera. Love the fingerprint sensor too! Best phone I have ever owned. Unlocked wow!
"September 22, 2017",5,Overall good mobile,Nice mobile with all the featues for best price. Liked
"September 22, 2017",5,Best for the money.,"I have had this phone a week and it is exactly as advertised; a unlocked mid-range phone with great battery life, no bloatware and a decent camera. So far the battery lasts 32 to 48 hours depending on usage, which was my main concern. If you want flagship specs & features, this is not for you. If you want a step up from a budget phone, this one is great."
"September 22, 2017",5,Great value and performance,"For the money, you can't go wrong! Everything the next Moto X should be!"
"September 22, 2017",4,Great value,Great phone for the price and you are not locked in to a carrier.
"September 22, 2017",5,Great phone for its price,Great camera and battery life. a bit big for my taste but does the job at a low price
"September 22, 2017",5,The best cheap phone.,"I have tried alot of cheap unlocked phones and I can say this is the best one you can get. If your on the fence, just get it."
"September 21, 2017",4,Now Phone is doing good,The first one had a problem charging but it was exchanged and now is doing great.
"September 21, 2017",5,Very powerful for the price!,"Bought this phone to replace my aging S5. This phone runs circles around it! Faster processor, more memory, and more storage. Plus, it will be getting the Android 8 Oreo update! You can't go wrong."
"September 21, 2017",5,Good phone,This is a good phone for people looking for an unlocked device that is not expensive. Have used previous Moto G also.
"September 21, 2017",5,Very good phone,All the bells and whistles and a good price and a very nice feel to it
"September 21, 2017",4,Good Price for a Smartphone,"Good features for a phone costing under 200$. Good Processor, 4GB RAM and better camera adds to the low cost phone."
"September 20, 2017",5,Great mid level phone,"Great phone for the price. Speaker is not as loud as I would like, but everything else is very good. Would recommend to mid level users."
"September 20, 2017",5,Best smart phone ever,I will never buy another Samsung or iPhone. I don't miss them. The Motorola G5 is the best thing since sliced bread. I'm very impressed with the storage capacity and the functions on this Motorola G5.
"September 20, 2017",5,Good phone,It has the power to work well and a price that doesn't take your bank
"September 20, 2017",4,"Does what I need, without costing $600","This was my first unlocked phone purchase. I had a Motorola Droid Razr M a long time ago and liked it, so I thought I'd try Moto. Battery life is great; I can get two days of use on a full charge. Camera isn't very responsive, and stock camera app needs to restart occasionally. Great connectivity without Verizon bloat. I took it from Best buy to a Verizon store and they put a nano SIM card in for no charge. One of the only unlocked phones I could find that still allows for microSD storage. At half the price of the flagship Androids, this was a no-brainer."
"September 20, 2017",5,Nice upgrade for me!!!,I upgraded to this Moto G5+ 64gb from an 8gb iPhone 5c... It is nice to not have to delete every other day... And not worry about space for photos videos or apps....plus I bought it when it had an additional $60 dollar discount from it's normal _$300 price (unlocked version) I've had to relearn some Android but very nice phone / and works fine on my ATT plan...
"September 20, 2017",5,Very good phone,Very good Android phone. The camera works even in low light. We were able to take some photos in a cave as well!
"September 20, 2017",5,Great Budget Phone,"I was lucky to have some discounts on this phone, otherwise I probably wouldn't have bought it for full price. It's definitely a great performing phone. Very quick, multitasks well, has tons of storage, the camera is amazing quality with 4k and hdr capability, and the speaker is plenty loud. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid phone but doesn't want to spend upwards of $800. It still does exactly the same things as those expensive ones, and even performs just as good for everyday stuff. Also it's pretty much waterproof! Just don't purposely submerge it. But it will most likely survive even if dropped in the toilet or bath. YouTubers verify this."
"September 20, 2017",5,Great phone for the money.,This phone has more memory and does almost everything my friends Samsung 7 does at 1/3 the price!
"September 20, 2017",5,No better phone for the price,This phone is awesome. I did a bunch of research and it paid off. Could not be happier !!
"September 20, 2017",4,Great Phone,I purchased this Moto G5 Plus. It's a great Phone. Fast and will not let you down. For the Price you have alot of storage with the 64 gig. Awesome phone. I would recommend.
"September 20, 2017",4,Fast fone ever,The best fone i ever had. Fast when surfing the internet.
"September 18, 2017",2,Disappointed,"Lousy outdoors, lousy clarity on volume call reception, owned Motorola b4 this is disappointed me"
"September 18, 2017",5,Great phone,"For under 3OO this is a great phone. Bright screen, quick response, not much bloatware, and good battery life.
Wish it had USB-C connector, but easy to find cables from anyone in a pinch. Recommend!"
"September 17, 2017",5,tremendous bang for the buck,A lot of phone for the money. The only thing I would add to the phone is a led notification light.
"September 17, 2017",4,Good phone for the price point,"This phone experience is smooth, has a great camera (although sometimes a bit shaky) and if available at a very reasonable price for an unlocked phone. Volume during a phone call is a bit low, however - hoping an update will correct that soon as it seems to be a common problem with this phone."
"September 16, 2017",5,My daughter love it.,My daughter always uses iPhone. I am tired of iPhone and decide to buy her an Android Phone. This phone is as smooth as iPhone and she just love it. App runs much faster (4G Ram) than her old iPhone 5s. It is pretty much as good as iPhone SE but a larger screen and expandable memory.
"September 16, 2017",5,Great phone good price,"Moto G5 plus with 4GB RAM is a great phone. Very responsive device. Keyboard is wonderful; much better than Samsung Galaxy S7 that I have. Does not have NFC but I do not need it. Soft ""back"" and ""overview"" buttons and the thumbprint scanner has swipe functions. Great value for the money."
"September 16, 2017",5,Loved the luggage,Found just what we wanted and the price was right.
"September 16, 2017",5,Best bang for your buck,Seriously an amazing phone for the price the only drawback is the camera. The battery is great and there's no lag.
"September 16, 2017",5,Great phone for its prize,So far so good. No cons. Would recommend to everyone.
"September 16, 2017",5,Best mid-priced smartphone!,"The Motorola Moto g5 PLUS is the best mid-priced smartphone available. With 64GB internal memory and 4GB RAM, it's very hard to beat the performance of this phone in this price range. The phone is very fast opening apps. And can handle having multiple apps running at the same time without lagging. The fingerprint sensor is definitely the best I've ever used. Works flawlessly. Love using the fingerprint sensor as my home screen navigation buttons, very cool. Battery life is excellent. Really like the split-screen feature as well. Allows you to have two apps running on the screen at the same time. Camera takes very good photos and video. Not as good as Sony Experia and a few others, although. Sound quality from speaker is very good as well. But, nothing to brag about. Call quality on this phone is very good also. HD Voice compatible if your carrier has it available in your area.This is the best deal for an unlocked smartphone you can find. Works great with my Cricket (AT&T;) prepaid service. And I can switch to any carrier I want with this phone eg. Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile etc. Which is awesome. Not that I'm planning on switching anytime soon. But nice to have the option. All you need to do is put a SIM card in this phone from your carrier of choice. Motorola has always made reliable phones and now they're getting very creative and innovative again. Nice to see from the original cell phone maker brand. Hello Moto!!!"
"September 15, 2017",5,very responsive,This phone is incredibly responsive.great camera..
"September 15, 2017",4,Great phone for the price,"I bought this for my wife on sale for $229.00 that's the 64gb with 4mb of ram version. It's a great phone at that price and luckily it's not a overly skinned mess like Samsung, Huawei, etc. I bought it to replace my wife's beloved nexus 5 because it was as close as I could get since Google killed of the nexus brand in favor of the overpriced pixel line. The phone is not bad at all. It runs well and is a good comfortable size. The only thing I thought was weird is that it doesn't have nfc especially when every company out there is trying to push wireless payments these days. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good phone at a reasonable price."
"September 15, 2017",5,Moto phone is good phone for all,"reasonable price for a good Moto phone, and easy to transfer the SIM card"
"September 15, 2017",4,Buy,"Value for money.,bit heavier than Nexus 5x.. but battery life is good ..."
"September 15, 2017",5,Good phone,Value for money. Nice camera and processing speed is good
"September 8, 2017",3,Good unlock phone,Good phone for the price brand and features and quality
"September 5, 2017",4,Best budge phone but some issues must know,"Pros
1. Good design, good build quality
2. Nice screen
3. very close to original Android, no garbage apps
4. affordable price with some discount.

Cons
1. Speaker volume is little low, if you are frequently using speaker phone mode, you might be in trouble.
2. compatibility issue with some headphone, mic is not working on AKG headphone. Jabra, JBL headphones are okay."
"September 2, 2017",5,Excellent value,"Purchased this phone on sale for $239. Excellent price considering its specs and the 64gb internal memory. Photo quality very good. Phone works excellent, fast and is quite smart."
"September 1, 2017",5,Fully satisfiled,Fully satisfied and value for money. Go for it. I recommend.
"September 1, 2017",4,Great phone.,Great phone for price. Works well. camera works great.
"September 1, 2017",5,Great value!,"So far, (2 weeks) I am very pleased with this phone Using it on T-Mobile network without any problems. Screen is very adequate for me even in bright sunlight. No hangups in having multiple apps open."
"September 1, 2017",5,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for a phone to upgrade from my old AT&T; GoPhone. After reading a lot of reviews and comparing specs, I decided on the Moto G5 Plus (4gb RAM, 64gb Memory).

Switching my service to it was a simple move of the SIM card, and the phone is beautiful booth in design and function."
"September 1, 2017",4,Great phone,Have only had about 2 weeks but so far it's been great. Much faster than my previous honor 5X.
"September 1, 2017",4,Great price for this product,"Lots of memory and good reviews, plus it was on sale."
"September 1, 2017",5,Moto g6,"Moto G6 works on all Networks.
Fast and reliable."
"September 1, 2017",5,Nice,I love this cellphone for me is cheap and you can use with different things. It was a good investment
"September 1, 2017",5,Much better than g3,Upgrade from g3 to this g5 plus and I am completely satisfied. Works fast and smooth. Wish I updated sooner.
"September 1, 2017",5,Great Phone for Price,"This phone is great for how low the price was. I've been using iPhones for years, and the transition to this phone was painless. It's fast, and seems to keep pace with flagship phones and less than half the price. I would highly recommend."
"September 1, 2017",5,Great performance with best battery backup,Great performance with best battery backup and the camera clarity not that good. But for the price its very good phone.
"August 31, 2017",5,Great budget phone,"Very pleased with the purchase. The phone is perfect for most of the people on my cell plan, and it will work with any carrier. It feels nice to know we can switch at any time and not have to get new phones. For a $200 phone, performance is great. The software is mostly stock Android. It's quick, light, and gets the job done. The bootloader is unlockable for those who wish to tinker."
"August 30, 2017",4,Excellent deal,"Deal breaker at this price; this model is not available in Canada, so glad I could benefit from a trip in the good old US of A and get the next generation of an unlocked Moto G Plus (already owner of a Moto G4 Plus previously).
Really improved generation: smoother experience (processor and 4GB RAM) , better camera, more internal space (64 GB), stronger frame etc..."
"August 29, 2017",5,Excellent Phone Compared to Android/iPhone,"I am coming from a Samsung S4, but have bought numerous budget and pricier phones for other members of my family. Recently I purchased and iPhone 6 for my daughter for example. 

I was little skeptical when first considering this phone as it is considered budget, but in every way it has exceeded my expectations. The big surprises for me is 

1) no Samsung/Apple bloatware. You are getting minimal preinstalled apps and very close to vanilla Android OS. This alone is a big plus as I don't have to deal with apps that I never used and are un-installable. 

2) The phone is fast with a beautiful display. Maybe not the fastest/best out there, but more than good enough for my purposes

3) The finger-print scanner is surpisingly, well awesome, and the Moto gestures are a very nice touch. 

I like this phone so much, my wife will be upgrading her phone to a moto g5 (or whatever) later as well. If you are in the market for an Android phone I would not hesitate to recommend this phone."
"August 28, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,If you're looking for an inexpensive phone this is the perfect choice
"August 26, 2017",5,Awesome phone at a great price,"The Moto G5 Plus is an awesome phone. Bare-bones Android with 4gb of RAM means this phone runs very smooth. Plenty of storage with 64gb of on-board and an SD slot. Charges fast and the charge lasts all day with quite a bit of usage.
I only have 2 gripes with it;
1) Camera bezel sticks out quite far on the back and without a case it feels like the lens is going to get scratched up easily.
2) Absolutely no notification light. Nothing blinks to let you know you have a message, text, or that the phone is charging when plugged in.
I have no problem dealing without the notification light and I put a good case on the phone so it covers the camera lens, so these are really small gripes.
The fingerprint reader, doubling as a one button navigation also, works flawlessly for me and is going to ruin any other phone that doesn't have it for me in the future. 
I went from an LG G4 to this Moto and I'm very happy with my purchase. I have already recommend this phone to friends and family and I will continue to do so."
"August 25, 2017",5,$240 for 64gb/4gb ram,"Got it at $240. Very fast interface. Smooth like butter. There is black bars when taking video using default camera app. You will notice it when panning the camera. However, if you use google camera app from the play store, the black bars do not appear. So there are some softwares issues with the default camera app. Other than that, this phone is incredible fast and has very good battery life. The single front speak is quite good too."
"August 25, 2017",5,kool,i like and i might want anothe rone for my wife...........................................................................................................................................
"August 25, 2017",4,Good all around phone,"The phone is of good quality. my only complaint is the CPU is not very powerful, while been good for daily use."
"August 25, 2017",5,Best bargain out there....,"Best budget phone currently. Fast processor and long lasting battery. 
Have had Motorola's in the past. Workhorse......."
"August 25, 2017",4,Good phone for the price,"My Note 4 finally died and I needed something unlocked to use until the Note 8 or iPhone 8 is released. I have had no issues with this phone besides the speaker. When you are in a quiet room the speaker is great, otherwise, use headphones."
"August 25, 2017",5,User friendly phone,Absolutely the most user friendly phone on the market
"August 25, 2017",5,Luv My Phone!,"So I am going from an old Galaxy 4 - which only gave me a half day of battery life a day. I've been holding on to it not wanting to spend the $ on a new phone but it kept going black on me, etc. After reading about this unlocked Motorola I decided I had nothing to lose. I AM SO HAPPY I DID! I just needed a phone for calls, checking email, surfing internet - I'm older and not obsessed with snap chatting or anything. This phone is fantastic. I go all day and still have another day of battery life left. The phone was so easy to figure out. I love the thumbprint touch to log in, I love just a gentle swipe right or left on the bottom button to get me where I need to go. Setting up the phone was completely intuitive - I figured out most everything. I went to my carrier to transfer my text messages and contacts off my phone. They were all freaking out over my Motorola - this is really cool. I luv not having all the bloat apps which I never used stuck on my phone. I can't believe this was under $300. I am very happy with reception/calling/volume. It's been a couple of weeks and I have no problems thus far. Would highly recommend."
"August 24, 2017",5,first phone ive paid for in years,"I wanted to upgrade my LG as it was a few years old,but it seems the days of good ""free"" phones are a thing of the past,so i decided to break down and buy 1,although it was kind of a spur of the moment purchase as an online store had them on special and BB matched their price.
 My only complaint and it is not with the phone but with the BB sales person,he sold me the $75 protection plan and said all i had to do was bring my phone in and they will replace it-he neglected to tell me that there is a $60 service fee if you do ever have to use the plan,My LG is 3ish yrs old and on a monthly plan through T-Mobile,my phone still had the plastic on the screen from date of purchase,so $135 was too much to pay for a protection plan imho,especially when he conveniently neglected to mention the service fee,i wouldve been very upset had i had to use it and was then informed of it-thankfully i found out soon enough to cancel it and get my 75 bucks back.
 As for the phone,for the price i paid-well below the $299 that it is being sold for-and i do mean much lower,this phone is incredible,it is miles ahead of my old LG,i heve no issues with the screen brightness-i think it is beautiful,i dont listen to music through it so cant comment on that,but i do use it on speaker phone all the time as im disabled and it is much easier,for a phone it is super fast if using for other things than a phone-i build desktop computers and the specs on this phone are incredible-more powerful than some laptops.The camera works quite well,i shoot a Canon 7D so a phone camera will never compare,but it takes nice pictures from what ive seen so far.
 With it being unlocked it was a breeze to swap all my info over to it and switch everything over to T-Mobile-although i did have to stop by my local store after leaving BB so they could finish,and do a proper job of transferring all of my apps and contacts etc over to it,again a shortcoming on BBs staff and their inability to do a job completely or adequately.
 So overall this phone is incredible for what i paid for it i expected to pay WAY more than just over 200 bucks for a phone of this quality,my friends that have to have the latest and greatest are very jealous of it and the cost LMAO .
 Again my only complaints are in the poorly trained staff at BB (they would rather chat with each other than help a customer with their full attention-as the sales guy was BSing w/his buddies while ""helping""??? me),another example is he said he applied my rewards points towards the purchase-which he did not do (i am an Elite Plus Member) so i earn a lot of rewards-i usually dont even ask for help when i go to BB as it is usually easier to know what i want,as they do not know their products they sell like they should.
 All in all i guess my only gripe would be is the lack of availability of good cases for this phone at brick and mortar stores,i did find great cases online for great prices-i couldnt decide on which 1 i wanted so bought both MIL SPEC armor cases-1 w/protective glass for screen,1 w/out for 28 bucks delivered-yes that is for both cases,and they arent cheap clear rubbery plastic ones."
"August 21, 2017",4,Lots of memory,"P'ssed that I paid $300 and 3 weeks later it's $70 less. 
64gb should delay using it all up for a while. I had the Moto3 before. I don't think this one has quite as good reception. Get ""No network available"" quite a bit."
"August 21, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,Purchased roughly a month ago to use on the Rogers network in Canada. Has worked flawlessly so far. Chose U.S. version because it has twice the memory as the international and I don't need dual-SIM or NFC. Migrated from an old Nexus in minutes - interface is nearly identical. No issues with sound quality as mentioned by Verizon users. Very satisfied
"August 19, 2017",5,Best value Android,It's not the best phone but it's the best value for money.
"August 18, 2017",5,Wow!,"Better than I thought it would be. No Bloatware and fast!!. I am a fairly heavy user and the battery is about 65% at day's end. Very HAPPY, WITH my purchase."
"August 18, 2017",4,Smooth functioning. Great features.,The octa core assists in smooth functioning of this phone. I was initially not very sure about this phone but after purchasing it I have not regretted a single day. Have recommended it to my friends as well. It's a nice phone with great features for the decent price.
"August 18, 2017",4,Good Value and Good Performance,"I had to retire my Windows Phone, and I do like this phone. It's my first Android, but I find the learning curve is easy. I was surprised how dependent you are on GMAIL and GOOGLE with Android, but it's no different than the Microsoft or Apple Cloud. It's a good unlocked phone with solid specs."
"August 18, 2017",4,Amazing picture quality. Easy setup.,"This phone was great for the price. It has a speedy processor, awesome camera and was easy to setup."
"August 18, 2017",5,Nice cell phone,This is a good phone and has a very good camera. Glass shattered when it got dropped but it was able to be repaired by third party.$$
"August 18, 2017",5,Everything in place,"I get enough internal storage, water resistance, 4gig of ram.....this phone rocks! A brilliant execution that keeps me free from the carrier Shylocks"
"August 17, 2017",5,Nice Phone,Really fast phone. But the design is just ok. Lenovo Skin is not the launch screen is not that good. Moto G family continue to be impressive.
"August 17, 2017",5,Great phone at a Great price!!,"I have used my Moto G5 Plus for several months now. It has been a great device. Excellent battery life (I get at least 2 full days of use if not 3), almost stock android that runs smooth. Camera is very good but not on par with the flagship phones out right now. But if you have a budget to stick to and want the best for your money, get this phone. I have the 4gb RAM 64gb storage version. was $299.99 but absolutely worth it!"
"August 17, 2017",4,"Good phone, great price!","If you are looking for a good mid level phone with a great price, then look no further. Motorola makes quality phones and this one is no exception. You can even add an sd card to expand the memory. Call quality is good. Of course because this is an Android phone, you have the freedom to customize it to your liking and make it your own.

I would recommend this phone for sure."
"August 16, 2017",4,Great Moto G5 plus,I'm happy with my Moto G5 plus and battery life much better so now I'm not worry about charge battery.
"August 16, 2017",5,A Very Good and Affordable Phone,"It is very fast, has a very good display, and a minimum of bloatware installed. The case is rather slippery to hold onto, so I highly recommend purchasing a protective case for it."
"August 16, 2017",4,Very Nice,"Very nice phone and at a good price. Performance is smooth, sleek and fast."
"August 16, 2017",5,Enjoy the phone,I like the freedom this phone provides. It doesn't have any bogus software.
"August 14, 2017",5,Great product,Product as expected. Easy to buy and got home in time
"August 13, 2017",5,"Extremely pleased, wonderful battery life","My old Nexus 5X died and I wanted a reasonably priced replacement. BB store recommended Moto G5. I have been very pleased with it so far. Biggest surprise is how amazingly long battery lasts. Nexus 5x could never make it through the day without recharge. G5 has had no problem at all for entire day. I am not a power phone use, but I could not be happier with it so far."
"August 13, 2017",4,Good phone but a little pricey,I bought this phone for my cousin and he was quite satisfied with it. The phone has a good camera.
"August 13, 2017",3,Good Phone,"I have this phone a couple weeks and is a really good phone, I really enjoy all features this phone has.However, the Only thing for me I dont recommend it is because of speaker is really weak."
"August 12, 2017",4,Love Moto,This version is a great phone. it is fast and has little lag to it. I miss the stereo speakers as in my gen 2 and the camera is good but i don't feel that it has as clear a shot as in previous versions. I get signal in most places where other phones with same provider does not get. No real complaints over all it is a great phone for the price. I would recommend this to those looking for a good budget phone.
"August 12, 2017",5,Great mobile for everyday,"This is an impressive good mobile, with loud sound and perfect focusing photos from too near up to panoramic shots."
"August 12, 2017",5,Perfect for my needs!,This is a terrific phone which fits my needs perfect. The camera on this phone is great and all functions of the phone are very user friendly.
"August 11, 2017",5,"Great battery, nice phone","I took my time and I'm glad I bought this phone. Has a great battery life, easy to set up and 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more than enough for what I need"
"August 11, 2017",5,Great phone,"This is an awesome phone. Stays charged, great pics I love it"
"August 11, 2017",4,Solid for the price,"The phone works as I would expect, probably better. It replaces a phone that was supposedly ""superior"" HTC MOne 9, but this surpasses that ."
"August 11, 2017",5,HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED LOVE THE BRIGHT COLORS.,"I LIKE THE PHONE, THE BATTERY STAY ALL DAY LONG, THE PRICE STILL HIGH BUT SHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG WILL LIKE MORE SOUNDS (RING.ALARM. ETC)"
"August 11, 2017",5,Great phone at an even better price,I got my Moto g5 plus with the simple mobile sim card and activation so it saved me $50. Which was a great deal. I love this phone the battery life is amazing it lasts me two almost two and a half days on light to moderate use and a day and a half on heavy use.
"August 11, 2017",5,Way better than what I expected,"I never wanted to spend a fortune on a phone. After reading many review of this 'budget' phone, I decided to purchase it. I have it for almost 3 weeks now and I have to say it works better than my old LG which cost way more than this phone. The best part is it is not loaded with branded bloated ware which just take up memory. I think it works like a $700 phone."
"August 11, 2017",5,Terrific Phone,"Purchased to use with T Mobile. Charged it, inserted the T Mobile sim card and turned it on to set up and all was working in about 15 minutes. Took another 15 minutes to install two sets of updates. Backed up my old phone and used that backup to reload all my apps. Had to re-download some offline maps for one of the apps, but otherwise all others worked. Have noticed no lag. Apps open quickly and with 4 gig RAM seem to work well with many apps in background. Display is sharp and bright. Battery life is exceptional, easily 2 days w/o charging for my use. Operating system takes 10.29 GB of the 64 GM storage. Apps take another 4 GM storage, leaving me 50 GB free. This model only takes one nano sim card, not two. Poor instructions showed 2 nanos installed - probably for an international model. Phone does have compass capability if used with downloadable apps."
"August 11, 2017",5,Excellent unlocked phone.,"This is a great unlocked phone. I've been using it for a week on the AT&T; network with no problems. I recommend the 64GB version to get the best performance. Apps open fast and navigation is quick. I like that it supports Micro SD memory cards for extra storage. It supports both GSM and CDMA networks so if I want to switch carriers I'm not limited to only certain networks. Also, there isn't a bunch of extra apps installed that I don't want, but can't remove. 

I had the associate at Best Buy install and provision the new sim card. It took only a few minutes and I was ready to go. 

To summarize, this is an excellent unlocked phone that performs well and is available at a reasonable price."
"August 9, 2017",4,Great options for store pickup,"Ordered this for a friend in Arizona. I live in other state, bestbuy has option so anyone authorized in online purchase can pick in any bestbuy location."
"August 7, 2017",4,Great phone,Great entry phone. Easy to use. Good battery. Wish Motorola had put NFC in it though
"August 7, 2017",5,Moto G5 plus = Winner,"I've had this phone for a couple months now, and I must say I love this phone and here's why. 1st I have T-MOBILE and was sick of (payment) plans for phones. Last had a Lg that crashed a little over a year from a update the caused bootloop that they where aware about. Happened to many customers from what I read. Long story short they couldn't help because phone was out of warranty and only choice was a newer phone. So I went the unlocked route, instead of the payment one which I'm still paying on for a broken phone. But anyway I popped the T-Mobile SIM into this and never looked back. 4G LTE works perfectly with this unlocked phone. And this phone hangs right there with phones that cost twice as much. Moto doesn't really promote this phone as waterproof but it is water resistant. And works perfect in wet/rainy conditions . Battery is the best in any phone that I've owned. Went camping for 3 days, everyone one else was looking to charge their phone after 1night and I had 80%. Last day still had 4 days left said the indicator at 45%. Fast charger is 2nd to none. Amazing fast and it holds battery. 1080 screen is clear and crisp. The only gripe I have with this phone is the camera. Supposed to compare with S7 but it falls short compared to that. Video quality is better then still pics as it records in 4k for Tv playback which is nice. Fingerprint sensor works great and is a nice touch at this price point, as well is 4gigs of ram and 64g of storage. I recommend getting geek squad protection as well for the price you can't beat it and it even covers one replacement battery if current one fails.. Wow and it's not an additional $10/15 on a month from a provider. I could say more but my final thought is you'd be hard pressed to find a better phone at the price point anywhere.. And it's runs Android 7.0 out of the box seemlessly no matter how many background apps are running.. Moto has won me back!!"
"August 7, 2017",4,Great,This is a good phone plus unlock so I can use it anywhere I go
"August 5, 2017",5,Great reliable phone,A nice phone at a great price with some incredible specs. Very fluid with the 4gigs of RAM and a clean version of Android nougat with minimal bloatware. Being compatible with almost all the networks is a huge plus too.
"August 5, 2017",5,better price,The picture quality on this phone is better than my Samsung
"August 5, 2017",5,Great value cellphone,"Excellent value cellphone. Very easy to use. Great features, without a lot of useless add-ins. Great battery life. Screen could be a little brighter in full sun situations, but no other issues. Great phone for the price."
"August 5, 2017",5,Flagship specs for less money,This is an unlocked phone that works with all carriers in the US. Some phones are CDMA and work with Verizon or Sprint only. Some are GSM only and work with T-mobile and AT&T; only. This phone works with them all. The specs are nice for $300 dollars or $230 if you are going with less memory. The moto g5 plus can compete with the Samsung phones and iPhones for half the cost.
"August 4, 2017",4,Good value,"The Moto does the job handsomely have great looks and good quality feel. The mltiple processors make it run smoothly and handle multiple apps and chrome tabs open at ease. The integration with Android is really good and with good functionalities. The coverage with Verizon have been good in Ames, all voice and data. WiFi and Bluetooth work well and with no problems. Battery gets you to the end of they comfortably. 
The camera is ok, but don't expect anything close to an iPhone or top of the range Samsung. It is logical to have some limitations at this price point. 

In summary it is a good value for money phone, specially if you don't use your phone as your primary camera"
"August 4, 2017",5,Personal phone,This is a good phone with key feature being able to work across different networks like GSM and CDM.
"August 4, 2017",5,Lenovo makes Motorola usable and respectable,"I've had real problems in the past with Motorola-branded cell phones and mobile technology in my life. If you don't care to hear about it, scroll down past the rest of this paragraph: Their bluetooth ear pieces always seemed to be of less-than-ideal quality. In fact, I had more luck with off-brands like Kinivo and other brands that don't even come to mind at the moment in terms of their bluetooth capabilities. The Motorola Electrify phone in particular was EXTREMELY unreliable in terms of both camera quality and battery life. It was very picky as to using factory chargers, so it would spaz out when I would be in a situation where I needed to charge it and didn't think to bring my charger with me from home that day. When Google bought Motorola out, I got my hopes up again, but was STILL not satisfied with what they came up with. I was put into a pretty undesirable situation when I had to either be without a phone for 48 hours (sadly not an option for me these days) or suck it up and buy this Motorola for like $300 while my phone was being swapped out by my insurer (which thankfully I at least got reimbursed for that). I figured if I was ever in the situation again where I'd need to have a backup cell phone, I'd thank myself for buying an unlocked phone as a backup. In a happy coincidence, Motorola had been bought out by a company who I've really grown to like and respect these past few years, Lenovo. I'm already familiar with the Android Operating System, so the learning curve was relatively non-existent, and since the protective case was only $20, I'm sure I'll look back on this emergency investment and be happy I made it when the time comes where I need another stop-gap phone. Either that, or maybe when my current phone just stops working, I might transition over to this one all together, and leave Samsung behind.

This cell phone was seamless from putting my SIM card in and charging it up, it worked like a dream. I had lost my contacts, but luckily had them stored in a cloud, so I was able to restore it almost fully in a pretty reasonable amount of time.

I'd like to give a shout-out to the Geneva, Illinois Best Buy store near Randall Road and Fabyan Parkway-- particularly their mobile phone department-- for getting me patched up and allowing me to buy this phone outright without contracts or hassles. Not even the Verizon store was willing to sell me a phone, even a refurbished one, without having to do monthly payments. That strikes me as kind of silly."
"August 4, 2017",5,"Great phone, especially for the price!",The phone has very good reception--much better than my older Samsung. The processor is very fast--all actions completed pronto! Battery life is exceptional--runs for days without charging. Screen is bright and clear--no problems reading anything.
"August 4, 2017",5,"Great phone, especially for the price","Don't like spending a lot on phones, this replaced an old Nexus 5, which I liked. The Moto G 5 plus looks and feels very nice to hold and use. Works like a charm, and I especially notice good battery life. The value here is unquestionable. Can't imagine anything being worth more than twice the price."
"August 4, 2017",4,Nice product switched from a Windows phone,Nice product. I thought the sales person was distracted and that aspect of the purchase could have been better.
"August 1, 2017",5,Haven't Opened Yet,Bought this because current/about to be former phone MotoG1 and I've really liked it. The best buy kid who sold this to me actually had it too and he said he loved it. The only reason why I haven't is because I can't find a case for it I liked. Will update when I can.
"July 31, 2017",4,Great Phone for the price,Phone has been working great so far and I have not encountered any lag or issues with it. Camera works great for a novice user. I am pleased with the purchase of this phone .
"July 29, 2017",5,Very cost effective,Excellent phone for the money. Wish the sound and speaker was higher quality.
"July 29, 2017",4,Moto G5 unlocked,"Worked flawlessly with my bring your own carrier. I did do my research first and so should you. The screen quality is not as good as my last phone, Droid Turbo, but good enough. Just put your SIM card and extra memory in and good to go. Note: Warning for all Moto users- overheating will fry your board. Keep it cool, close your apps."
"July 29, 2017",4,So far so good,We bought this for our daughter and she loves it so far. The real test will be when she gets to Japan. We bought it for this purpose since she will be there for a year. Sales stated that this phone should work there.
"July 29, 2017",5,"So far a great phone, great speaker for videos","For the money this is a great phone. Camera is awesome. The speaker is nice and loud, plus it's on the front of the phone. Long battery life, charges quickly. Very easy to navigate apps and features."
"July 29, 2017",5,Good phone so far.,"This phone replaces my two year old Galaxy 6, which I really liked. After a month, I can say that I am very satisfied. I like that it's unlocked, international and has 64GB of memory. I like the battery's capacity to last at least 24 hrs even with location and data turned on. The camera takes very good pictures too."
"July 29, 2017",5,great budget phone,"phone is fast, stock interface, decent camera for the price. I bought this to replace my Samsung S7 and have no regrets."
"July 28, 2017",5,great mid priced phone.....better than avg camera.,agree with the reviews....not bloated software on Android...works fast....impossible to beat for the money
"July 28, 2017",5,Excellent phone. Completely satisfied,I bought this phone after my Note 4 was stolen. I had used Samsung phones for years but this phone is a big upgrade from the Note 4. I would but the G5 Plus again in a heartbeat.
"July 28, 2017",5,Great bang for the Buck,I love this phone. It is a great intermediate size. I prefer having phones without carrier branding/apps.
"July 27, 2017",5,Pure Android.,Great phone. Pure Android experience. No bloat ware.
"July 23, 2017",4,Great phone for the price,Caught it in sale for 249.00 could beat the price.
"July 23, 2017",5,Best deal out there.,"The G5 Plus is a whole lot of phone for not a whole lot of money. The array of features and capabilities are plentiful, especially when you consider the price. It might not have all the bells and whistles of the latest and greatest, but it sure comes pretty darn close. Some have stated that the voice sounds a bit tinny, but I haven't had that experience with mine. I find the reception and voice quality to be exceptionally good. The size is perfect for my small to medium hands and the buttons are easy to access without any significant effort. There is no doubt this phone gives you the most bang for the buck. I highly recommend it without any reservation."
"July 22, 2017",4,Great phone for the everyday user,"Amazing battery, very fast and responsive phone
Average camera at night, good photos in good lighting"
"July 22, 2017",5,Very Happy for $250,"got it while it was on sale, for about $250 and very happy with it."
"July 22, 2017",5,Great battery life,"Good all around cell phone, very fast! Lots of storage."
"July 22, 2017",4,Does all I want it to.,"Nice Android phone does all I want it to for half the price of a Samsung. Using wifi (mostly) and Tracfone access, I get what I need on the cheap. Hard drive is big enough for apps, and isn't going to fill up with bloatware right away. I only rated it four stars because it doesn't pretend to be a Five Star phone. I'm very happy with this purchase."
"July 22, 2017",4,Very cost effective,"Great performance and value. Only one level below Samsung S80, however only one third the price!

Good compromise/sacrifice for not having WIFI calling feature and no NFC."
"July 22, 2017",4,Very good phone,I purchased this phone for my son and he loves it.
"July 22, 2017",4,Pretty decent phone,In the beginning I couldn't figure out how to answer a call once I figured that out this phone is everything I needed in a phone and more. Has more features than my Galaxy 5.
"July 22, 2017",5,Awesome phone,"Love this phone, didn't come with all the junk I don't use anyway!"
"July 21, 2017",5,Best budget smartphone on the market,"For the average user, this phone will do just as well as phones that cost almost three times the price. Great battery life, fingerprint sensor, near-stock Android and solid build quality."
"July 21, 2017",5,Love it,"I love the way it works, just took a little time to learn it's operations, took pictures with it already, they have wonderful quality. I am pleased that I have it, would not trade it for any other."
"July 21, 2017",5,Great phone and excellent price,"I love the phone, the picture quality on portraits is amazing, I'm still learning all its function's, but so far very satisfied with the purchase."
"July 21, 2017",5,Overall a great device,"Phone has a solid build and sleek design. Call quality is good, apps run fast, and it has a ton of memory! Camera is about average. Very happy with my purchase."
"July 21, 2017",5,Best Value for an Android Phone,Needed an inexpensive Android cell phone and after reading the reviews decided to purchase the Moto G 5 Plus.The 64gb model with 4gb ram is very responsive. The call quality is excellent and I love Motorola's clean interface. Battery life is excellent lasting more than two days after medium use. You can use the turbo charger to quickly recharge.
"July 21, 2017",5,Great phone no bloat,This is a great phone and it has no bloat ware. I like the 64G of RAM. My only complaint is not with the phone but with Android since the Google search bar is forced on the home screen. I am using Nova Launcher to get rid of it.
"July 21, 2017",5,Great performance,"Very impressed with this phone, performs as well if not better than my previous phone, a Nexus 6p. If this phone had nfc it would be perfect."
"July 21, 2017",4,A great phone at a great price.,The Moto G Plus 5th Generation is a great phone at a very affordable price. It is an attractive phone and is faster than the last generation Moto G.
"July 21, 2017",5,Great phone,"Does the job of more expensive phones, 64 GB of memory, 4 GB of ram, excellent camera plus lot more for $300"
"July 21, 2017",4,Great phone for the money,"Had phone (4G/64GB version) for about 2 months and so far pretty pleased with purchase. Battery duration is excellent. Turbo charge is outstandingly quick. Finger print sensor the best I have ever used, rarely misses the first light tough of my finger. Processor speed very functional, no noticeable lag. Plenty of memory and has capacity for microSD card. Dropping one star due to very tinny sounding speaker. Also the camera does not have an internal stabilizer. You need to hold hand very steady. Great phone for the price. Would buy again."
"July 21, 2017",5,Good phone for the money,Best unlocked phone for this amount of money. Fast phone and good battery life.
"July 21, 2017",5,Big bang for your buck!,"I've had cell phones since the early 90's, way before they went global in popularity. This is a top shelf product without the exaggerated price to go with it. Finally, a 64G phone with 4G of RAM for a price that doesn't break the bank. And the frosting on the cake is that Best Buy will match the price should you find it elsewhere for less, which is exactly what I did. Battery life is great, I can easily get 24+ hours with one charge. I use it primarily for 1. internet -teaching classes, searching info, shopping, news, messaging, FB, Twitter. 2. Camera, which is outstanding. And 3. Calls. No complaints whatsoever. Am not into it for music or games. And yes, this may sound like a girl-thing, but I finally got the gold one! I know it's not a big thing for some users, but it sure is for those of us who've been using cell phones since they were the size of a Honda. 
This sleek, gorgeous model is comfortable in the hand with just the right amount of heft, and durable with its newest generation gorilla glass screen. A win/win!"
"July 20, 2017",4,nice phone,this phone is a good alternative from the i-phone.
"July 20, 2017",3,decent phone but difficult for me,"Phone is good but for someone new to smartphones it's not easy to understand all functions even after downloading the manual. With the instructions it still takes many attempts to get the function right. It's almost impossible to download your music library even with the manual, My Expert, and talking to staff at Best Buy. I think there must be an assumption that the buyer is an experienced smartphone user. Google Play is not well structured for manipulating your Library even after you find a way to download it. I find myself spending way too much time figuring the phone out. I probably should have gone with an Apple so I could go sit down in one of their classes after purchase and with one of their staff. Best Buy should consider something similar."
"July 20, 2017",5,The best mid-range phone I've ever used,"The Moto G5 Plus, it's a mid-range powerhouse that'll last you into the wee hours of the night. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy a phone with great specs without breaking the bank."
"July 20, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,This is my 2nd Moto G (unfortunately I had to have a funeral for the 1st). A sales person suggested I give this phone a try. I had gone in with a specific well known phone in mind. I am so happy I decided to listen to their advice! Easy to operate and fast. Absolutely love it.
"July 19, 2017",4,Overall good!,"For the price, this was a pretty darn good phone! It takes pretty good pictures and has plenty of room. Just over a month in and I am having some issues with the Google search function, but I'm not sure if I did something or if it was the phone. But overall, I am very happy!"
"July 19, 2017",5,Great low-cost phone,"For the money this phone is a great deal.
My son loves his new phone"
"July 19, 2017",5,Excellent for the money,"So far this phone has met all my expectations. It is quite responsive and I don't notice any lag, though I have many apps installed. 

The camera is a huge improvement over my first generation Moto g LTE."
"July 19, 2017",5,Great battery life,So far so good with my moto G5 plus 64g. I'm ending my day with over 50% battery left. Performance is good normal Web & app stuff. Simple games run fine. Cell coverage on Att is good.
"July 19, 2017",5,Excellent midrange phone,"Happy with performance and no bloatware, but wish it had a notification led."
"July 19, 2017",5,Motorola rocks,Larger screen and more memory than my last phone. This is the 5th Motorola I've owned. Easy to operate and an excellent value for the price.
"July 19, 2017",5,Great item.,Expected no less from Motorola. All the bells and whistles. No crashes at a great price.
"July 18, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,Great phone for the price. I did not care for the default app launcher and installed the Nova Launcher.
"July 17, 2017",5,Great Phone with Great Price,"I am very happy with this phone after over a month of heavy usage. Performance is great. Battery life and recharge has been better than expected. Only changes would be fingerprint reader on back middle and headset plug on top, but that is personal preference. Other comparable unlocked phones are significantly higher price."
"July 17, 2017",5,Great bargain phone,"Battery lasts most of the day with extremely heavy use. Phone never lags, even with multiple games and apps open in back ground. Nice features my HTC didn't have. Inserted my AT&T; sim card, linked my Google account, phone was ready to go. Go buy, you won't be disappointed"
"July 16, 2017",5,Amazing phone!!!,"Works great, great battery life, nice camera and processor."
"July 15, 2017",5,Great Phone,"Is it a Galaxy or an IPhone? No, it's not. But then it doesn't cost almost $1,000.00 either. This phone has an octo-core so it's really fast with 4GB of RAM. It's got 64GB internal memory. Who needs an SDHC card. I don't need no stinkin' SDHC card! And on sale it only cost me $240.00. And no bloat!!! Yay!!! A great camera! Can work on ANY network and is unlocked. Sprint is letting me bring it to my plan no charge for 1 year. We'll see what they've got to offer in a year. The absolute only thing that I find a negative about it is that it is not water resistant. This does concern me somewhat but I bought the 2 year geek squad warranty so that should take care of that. I don't normally buy extended warranties except on my electronics. This one was a bit pricey so I had to think about it for a week but ended up deciding to get it since phones are at such risk of damage. A bit more on the camera I've never taken such FAST pics with a phone. You click to take the pic n it takes it. No delays, no wondering when it's going to take the pic, no hoping your hand is steady enough so that the pic isn't blurred. You click n it's taken. Because there is no bloat I can add the apps that I really want. Like Samsung Health. I do still need to learn more about the phone but I really like it so far after about 1 1/2 weeks. I did a lot of research before I bought it n I think I did well. I'm sure the flagship phones can do lots more than I need so certainly some will need one of them. But I don't."
"July 14, 2017",5,It is a great phone.,It is a great phone. Like the camera and the ease of use.
"July 14, 2017",5,Great phone for the cost,This is a great budget Phone. It does everything I need it to for a good price. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a flagship phone but it's mostly the stuff I never used that's missing
"July 14, 2017",3,It's an average phone,I had problems with the phone. It gets switched off while talking if you access any apps. Also there was some problem with the button.
"July 14, 2017",5,High performance phone for a mid performance price,"This phone exceeded my expectations, with similar specs as the more expensive flagship phones. It keeps up with anything I've tried to do. Most importantly, it doesn't include the carrier bloat that many other phones include."
"July 14, 2017",5,Most Bang for the Buck,"This phone is awesome. There's a lot of quality built into it for the price. You'd have to spend two to three times more money to get something better, and the margin for better is very small. The camera is wonderful, taking sharp well light-balanced photos. The auto-focus is blazingly fast. No chance of missing your shot. It also has a lot of security features, which give you the option to use or not. Some have said the voice through the speaker sounds a bit tinny, but I couldn't tell. The maximum volume setting could be a bit higher, but the sound quality was good. I highly recommend it...you won't be disappointed."
"July 14, 2017",5,An Excellent Android Smartphone at a Good Price,"I love this phone. It replaces an aged Samsung Galaxy S4 which ran out of storage space. I love everything about it:
1) looks
2) speed
3) performance
4) loads of storage space (64GB version w/ 64GB miniSD card)
5) 4GB of memory
6) Beautiful display
7) Almost no crapware preloaded

However, there are a few minor exceptions:
1) The back of the phone is really slippery, so get a good case for it since you will likely drop it at some point (I dropped mine the first day).
2) Transitioning from earlier Samsung enhanced Android to a pretty much stock Android 7.0 Noughat takes some getting used to but it is still overall much better."
"July 14, 2017",5,Great phone for the money,"This is a great phone for $299. Very good display and cameras, fast, high quality build, and not too big to go in a pocket with a case on it. Also no software or device issues like with less expensive Androids I have had in the past. Android 7 is way better than prior versions and even better than iOS 10, which I still have on my spare iPhone."
"July 14, 2017",5,Excellent,"Excellent phone,. Does everything phones twice the price do."
"July 14, 2017",5,Amazing 'budget' phone.,"Great phone. Good battery life, love the Moto gestures. Almost stock Android no bloatware or garbage pre installed. Good (not great) camera. For the price you could buy much worse phones. Fast snappy processor. Would totally recommend this phone to anyone on Cricket looking for a good unlocked phone."
"July 14, 2017",5,Nice Phone,I loved this phone and the color is very beautiful. Price is wonderful.
"July 13, 2017",5,Love the phone,"I love my new phone. I like that it was easy to use and set up. I don't want a contract phone, this was the best way to go for me. Like the fact that I put what I want on it, not what my carrier wants."
"July 10, 2017",4,3000 mAh battery lasts two days,"This is the first unlocked phone I've purchased, and I've been pretty happy with it over the first couple of weeks. I'm using the phone on Verizon. I walked into a Verizon store and they gave me a nano SIM card for it, and activated it free of charge. The battery life is great. It accommodates an external microSD card, which is a must for me. The camera is slow to focus and respond to shutter push. It has been fast on WiFi and 4G connections. It doesn't come bloated with extra apps that I don't want and can't get rid of. The fingerprint unlock has worked pretty well with both of my thumbs. I appreciate the notification previews that allow me to see what's there without having to unlock the screen. I wasn't expecting this to rival the top of the line Verizon flagship phones, but for $300 it is a very functional bargain compared to the $700 or so you'll drop on those."
"July 9, 2017",5,G5 plus great,"Love the cost and how fast it is.
The fingerprint reader is great on a bargain phone."
"July 9, 2017",5,Phone has WiFi calling and excellent reception,"The Moto 4 gen doesn't have WiFi calling capable. And the Moto 5 gen. Same great reception, but traveling WiFi calling is a must have.
Great phone for the money. Nothing comes close!"
"July 9, 2017",5,Great smartphone that meets my needs.,This newly released smartphone meets all my needs at a very reasonable price. I purchased it online and picked it up at a nearby store 30 minutes later.
"July 9, 2017",5,Great phone,No bloatware. This watch has everything I need in it
"July 8, 2017",4,Good battery life,It's not the best looking nor the fastest phone but it gets the job done.
"July 7, 2017",5,Great budget phone with great features,"Battery is excellent, phone is fast and camera quality is comparable to good phones. Worth it!"
"July 7, 2017",5,Solid Phone,"My Samsung Note 5 died in me, and I needed a quick replacement. This phone is fairly fast, and the screen is large. Not too different than my Note for my needs."
"July 7, 2017",5,Great all-around unlocked phone.,"The G5 plus will perform all your productivity & entertainment tasks easily and last all day for about half the cost of most phones out there.

It offers 4GB of ram, 64 GB of onboard memory, it is expandable to 128GB, has 3,000 mAh battery with an included turbo charger, screen resolution of 1080p, back camera is 12mp, front camera is 5mp front, runs Android 7.0 out of the box, has no bloatware, it is unlocked, and it is decently priced. NFC is the only thing on my wish list for this phone.

I'm very happy and highly recommend it."
"July 7, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,"Compared to Galaxy S8 at $750, G5+ at $300 is a bargain. I don't miss any features that may be lacking. Battery lasts all day. All features work very quickly."
"July 7, 2017",5,Good phone for the money,Good unlocked phone for the money. Battery last with medium use about 2 days.
"July 7, 2017",5,Good phone for the price,Mid range phone with raw Android OS and no bloatware.
"July 7, 2017",5,Great phone great price,I really like the way Moto leaves the Android OS alone and gives the consumer Android like it was designed. The 5.2 screen size is perfect alot of phones are just too big for people to carry comfortablely. The preformace has been outstanding.
"July 7, 2017",5,"Awesome, for real","Reading other reviews, there are people saying a lot of good stuff about this phone. And they are all right! The speech ""this is just like a 600.00 phone but cheaper"" is totally accurate. I bought the Moto G5 64 GB with 4GB of RAM - which I recommend to everybody. The RAM memory makes a lot of difference when it comes to performance and speed."
"July 7, 2017",5,Excellent Value,"The Moto G5 Plus has the look and feel of a current Samsung at half the price. User interface is very friendly, communications are clear, and battery life is a consistent 3-5 days. Very nice unit."
"July 7, 2017",4,Good unlocked phone,It is an acceptable replacement for a phone that had gotten wet. Easy to use and was easy to set up.
"July 7, 2017",5,Fast Sleek and Sharp,"The Moto G5plus loads everything quickly. The screen is bright, sharp, and clear. No problem multitasking with the 4GB RAM. The battery life is amazing, used to recharging daily or before, but have been lasting 2 days plus and still > 20% left when I do recharge."
"July 7, 2017",5,Great phone for a reasonable price,"After researching all of the available options for unlocked cellphones, I found that this phone has the features that I wanted and needed for a price that I could tolerate. It has been easy to set up and use. I am looking forward to having this phone for a good long time!"
"July 7, 2017",5,Excellent,Awesome! Best phone I have ever bought. All whistles attached! Way to go Moto
"July 4, 2017",5,Best value for money,"This is definitely one of the best value for money phones out there.

Pros:
5.2 inch screen size is perfect, with the option of removing the nav bar below by using actions on the fingerprint sensor. Brilliant.
64 GB option available. Works fast for average use. Good screen.

Cons:
No NFC for Android Pay. No other problem yet noticed."
"July 3, 2017",4,Overall good,Pretty good phone. finger print feature is nice. Easy to use.
"July 1, 2017",5,Good price,"Great memory, good photos, good sound.not hard to get used to the different settings."
"June 30, 2017",5,Great Phone!,This is my 4th Motorola phone and all have met my expectations.
"June 30, 2017",5,"Great phone, great deal",Has the power and easability as it's expensive cousins at one third the cost of a Samsung 8.
"June 30, 2017",5,Great value for strong performer,"Got this to replace Moto G4 which worked fine, but I wanted more memory. This Moto G5 Plus has 4GB RAM and 64GB memory. Twin LED flash, fingerprint unlock, works perfectly."
"June 30, 2017",5,Excellent Budget Phone,"So far I love this phone. 64 gig of storage, quad core processor and 4 gig of RAM. Operation is smooth and fast and it comes without all of the bloated crapware that major carrier's phone have. Almost just pure Android. The display is clear and bright and battery life is phenomenal! Sure, it doesn't have some of the more sophisticated bells and whistles of much more expensive phones but most of those bells and whistles are just fluff in the end. The only thing I do miss is the ability to be a wifi hotspot. Great phone at a great price. Highly recommended."
"June 30, 2017",5,Great cell for the price,"It is a good device, fast and for a fair price. I recommend it."
"June 30, 2017",5,Great phone with awesome battery life,"I purchased the 64GB, 4GB Ram model. Incredible battery life. The phone last 2 days for me while my previous Nexus 6 was down to about 6 hrs. The phone works great with Android Auto too. Hands down improvement over my Nexus 6 and for $300. My daughter has a Samsung 7 edge. The Edge does have a better camera although this one is not bad."
"June 28, 2017",5,great mid priced phone,was an upgrade from a dying note 4. a little tough to get data transfered. nice size & feel. performs faster than the note.
"June 26, 2017",5,Love this phone!,"I'm very happy with my new phone, it does everything I was looking for!! So easy to work, even for me..."
"June 26, 2017",5,Great Unlocked Phone,This is a great unlocked and affordable phone with several nice features.
"June 26, 2017",4,Great phone,"I switched from an iPhone 6. The only thing I miss is the ability to do apple pay when I'm out. It's a tad wider than I prefer because I have small hands, but it's still a great phone. The fingerprint function works even better than my iPhone did. I have no regrets."
"June 26, 2017",4,Best budgeted phones,"+ good display
+ 4GB RAM is amazing for the price
+ nice processor 
- bad camera"
"June 25, 2017",5,Great phone,"I love this phone. The pictures are phenomenal, especially the selfies. The processing speed is great and getting the 64gb was the best decision I ever made"
"June 24, 2017",4,Great Value!,"I've never owned an IPhone or Samsung Galaxy so this is not a comparison. However, as an Outside Sales Rep, I'm on my phone constantly. Reliable phone, email, text and sometimes Google Hangouts (think IPhone FaceTime) are essential to my job. The Moto G Plus delivers rock solid performance."
"June 24, 2017",5,Great phone,"This phone doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it does what I need it to do: make calls, send texts, surf the internet, take pictures. It does all of those things really well so far and I'm very happy with the look, function and price. Why spend an extra $400-500 for the Samsung or iphone when I can buy this phone?"
"June 24, 2017",5,Great phone,Value for Money and best buy price match awesome !
"June 24, 2017",5,Best bang for the buck.,Did tons of research before making this purchase. Wanted a phone to replace wife's broken S7 which we are leaving Samsung due to poor build quality. This phone feels really good in the hands. Love how it's not all glass which can break easily which Samsung wants. This Moto G5 is just as fast as S7. Cell reception is better compared to S7. Only complaints are the camera hump on back and it's lacking an AMOLED screen which I love on the S7. Would buy the G5 again.
"June 23, 2017",5,Great cell phone for the price!,"I didn't want to lease a phone, nor did I feel like paying $600 plus outright for a cell phone. The price was reasonable and I'm very satisfied with the quality of the Moto G 5 plus. 
It's also unlocked, so I can easily switch cell phone providers, if I choose to."
"June 23, 2017",5,The Right Choice,I almost went for the Iphone. Almost. So glad I stuck with my android. What an easy transition and perfect phone! Perfect size and feels just right in my hand.
"June 23, 2017",4,Great phone for the money,"Very good phone, great battery life. Nice display only weak spot is speaker a little weak."
"June 23, 2017",5,Great budget phone,A great phone at an even better price point. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheaper device with decent specs.
"June 23, 2017",5,Great phone,"I like that you can get a good phone with 4gb ram,64gb storage,great battery life,and great performance for $300. This phone is awesome. Well done Motorola."
"June 23, 2017",4,good budget phone,"for the price, specs of this phone is good. battery life is normal. if i use for a day, i still got 55% of battery left. camera isn't great but it does what it needs to"
"June 23, 2017",4,Nice phone and big enough.,"I like the phone, just have to get use to a Samsung. Had a I phone before."
"June 23, 2017",4,Very nice phone for the price,"I was replacing my Moto E phone with an updated model. So far I really like it. Everything is pretty much the same to me, but the camera. The camera on this phone is night and day better. Great battery life too. I only have to charge it every other day with my normal use. The only thing I don't like is that I can't seem to figure out if there is someway to make it have a blinking light when there is a message or missed call. If I could figure that out I would give it 5 stars."
"June 23, 2017",4,Nice Phone,"I needed to replace a phone that had died the night before so I looked at all the available options of phone. The three things I wanted was that the phone wasn't locked to a carrier, that the phone was at least on Android 7 and that the phone wasn't overly expensive. This phone met the criteria. My only problem with the phone is that I don't believe I get updates to Android. The version of the OS is dated back in January of 2017. I have yet to see any security updates. Otherwise I phone is fine.."
"June 23, 2017",4,Great phone for the money!,Very happy with my new Moto G5 plus. Much faster than my old Moto x and the battery life is fantastic. Almost lasts two days with varied use. Highly recommend for the money.
"June 23, 2017",5,"Great, Multi-Tasking Device","The best phone you can buy without a contract, unlocked and ready to use with multiple networks.

I bought mine at Best Buy and then went to a Verizon store, where they put the SIM card in and activated my phone using a $40 prepaid card.

I use my phone mostly for business and my previous phone was just too slow and had trouble handling multiple apps at once. This one seems almost too good to believe. Apps open quickly, I can switch between email, messaging, GPS, and other apps seamlessly and with no delays.

I couldn't be happier.

I do strongly recommend the 4GB of RAM version phone."
"June 22, 2017",5,Works great,"The operating system is easy to use and it did not come with all the junk apps that you get when you buy a phone connected to a specific carrier. 
Charges fast and has good battery life."
"June 22, 2017",5,Excellent phone,"Well worth the money, fast performance, definitely recommend this phone over Samsung"
"June 22, 2017",4,Worth for the money,"Pros:Long battery life, camera performance is good, user friendly.
Cons: I accidentally press the power button often and ended up restart..because of power button positioning (middle of right side)"
"June 22, 2017",4,Great value,"This is a great phone so far. Charges fast, battery lasts all day. Fingerprint sensor is great. Only downside is the camera isn't all that great."
"June 21, 2017",5,Best value for smartphone,"This phone is amazing. For the money it can't be beat. It is very quick, I've experienced no lag in any situation. Screen is plenty bright even in strong sunlight. Photos are fine. Sound from the speaker is OK, nothing to rave about but at least it is front facing. It's great not having all the bloatware of other phones. The Moto motion apps are fun and useful.
I installed a free nano sim ordered from Verizon (there are different types of nano sims so be sure to get one appropriate for the phone). Took a bit of work from Verizon agents to get it activated but not too bad. Service has been great; calls are clear both directions. Since it is unlocked, I can take it to any of the other providers.
My only complaint is that I wish it were a little smaller; phones are so huge now.
For comparison, I tried a Samsung Galaxy S7 and was not that impressed.
Bottom line: you can't go wrong with this phone."
"June 21, 2017",4,Great Phone for Price,"Bought this to use on ATT network in Northern NJ area....great phone for the price...however note that Best Buy sells the American version that is single SIM...it's advertised as Dual-SIM but this is Single Nano Sim with no NFC...the network bands/antennas could be better in my area because when you're on 3g, it appears as H on the phone and i'm not sure if that's 3g or 2g but it is slow....but no real complaints for an UNLOCKED phone with flagship comparable specs for $299"
"June 21, 2017",5,Best budget cell phone there is.,For the price you can't beat it. The Moto gestures are great too.
"June 21, 2017",5,So far so good,"The battery life has been excellent for me I've played game talked and texted and still had battery power...the phone has lots of nice features, I bought 2 and they both have not had any problems, I have left the Galaxy and I'm not missing anything yet"
"June 21, 2017",5,Motorola is great,"Moto G, is an amazing phone. I usually just use Samsung, but reading reviews and listening people talking about changed my mind. I love it!"
"June 21, 2017",4,Solid Purchase,"My two-year-old Nexus 6 began to use battery life so it was time for a replacement.

I have been very pleased with the Moto G5 Plus. It is very feature-packed and a solidly-built phone for people who like Android apps. The only disappointment that I could point to is the lack of using Android pay - alas no NFC functionality.

By the way, the phone's camera is wicked fast."
"June 21, 2017",5,Great unlocked phone,This phone is sharp. It is very fast and has 4 times the space and memory as my last phone. It seems to be very intuitive.
"June 19, 2017",5,"Excellent, why spend $700-1000.00 a year?","I used to be an Iphone user. Left for a Moto X two years+ ago, then upgraded to a Moto X extreme edition a year ago for a great deal(about $225.00 for a 64GB)...unfortunately broke that phone and screen. Decided to see what was the current Moto model and came across this. another 64GB phone+added my 128GB microsd card. Love that this phone has finger reader....i hated entering code every time to unlock old phone. This phone doesn't have NFC or google pay but I never used it on last phone despite the fact that i enabled it and then had to have a pass code for security. Some have quipped about the lens sticking out a bit....doesn't matter once you put a case on it, even the thinnest cases make the the camera lens flush. Perfect size...can actually get my thumb across the screen for one handed operation. fast, good screen, good battery life. Looks just like a Iphone...if that's what your after...not really something I was looking for but get a lot of people ask is that an iphone...nope and i could buy four of these for the price of one iphone or samsung. Also used rewards points to lower price total to about $260.00 for phone and then paid the extra for a two year geek squad protection(not normally something id do)....figured I'll probably do something once in two years that will most likely net me a fix or an new phone. Great deal. Great phone. And I get two free payments on my BMW X3 by purchasing this vs. Samsung or apple."
"June 19, 2017",4,I had problems with the voicemail setup.,"Admittedly, I am electronically handicapped. The phone appears to be great but I am having a hard time learning to use it. I finally downloaded the instruction booklet and am in the process of working my way through it."
"June 19, 2017",4,Excellent buy,"Having previsously owned iPhones and Samsungs, I would say this device is right in line with these brands, though MUCH cheaper. The 64 Gb gives you a lot of flexibility and the way it functions overall is quite smart, better in many ways than the other 2 brands. However, a minor aggravator is that it does not show badges (that little red dot with the number of unread messages), though there are workarounds for this. GPS is really fast and precise, great buy overall."
"June 17, 2017",4,Good Solid Android Phone,This is a good Android phone. 4gb of ram and 64gb of storage. It handles all basic needs without difficulty.
"June 17, 2017",5,Great basic SmartPhone,"Was looking for an internationally unlocked phone to send as a present to family in Chile. The phone looks great and, up to my knowledge, is working fine.

Great purchase!"
"June 17, 2017",4,Great Phone,"Only had it for a week so far, but am really impressed. Love the fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone."
"June 16, 2017",5,Like it,"My boyfreind loves
 it it was a surprise for him best gift he enjoying"
"June 16, 2017",5,Love this!,Excellent phone & excellent price! Hope Lenova will add more accessories. So far protective case only in two colors.
"June 16, 2017",5,This phone rocks...,"I upgraded to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy S6, this phone has an amazing battery life, super fast, and 64gb of storage..... I love this phone"
"June 16, 2017",4,Nice phone,"No nfc but not a big deal, good battery and great storage ."
"June 16, 2017",5,Great phone for the Android purist on a budget.,"I love this phone. It feels good in your hands. The OS responds quickly. It is almost pure Android, save for a single Moto app installed on the phone."
"June 16, 2017",5,Excellent phone,"Fast, good size, beautiful screen. Unlocked for all carriers. Recommend to all."
"June 15, 2017",5,Great phone for $300,"Performs really good, it's pure Android, buy it without think."
"June 13, 2017",5,For the price it's a great phone,"Bought this after my wife bought one. It has all the basic features that you need plus it's unlocked so you don't have all the cell provider's bloatware installed. I have the non-Amazon version so it just had the basic Google applications with lots of space for what I want.
Only odd thing is that there is no indicator light on the front of the phone to indicate a notification so you have to touch or pickup the phone to see if there is anything that needs attention."
"June 13, 2017",5,Best Phone for the price.,"I would recommend this phone. It's fast, not to mention that the battery last a long time. It includes fast charging so that's always nice. Overall I think I will be using this device for a while."
"June 13, 2017",5,processor,"fast and great processor. It is easy to use this phone with only one hand, the fingerprint reader works fast , I highlight autonomy along with fast charger"
"June 12, 2017",5,Great Phone - Half the Price,"This phone has been great. I now own two. Great battery life. Very little down side. (No NFC or 802.11ac) But, for less than half the price of the Samsung Gal 7, I'm ok with it."
"June 10, 2017",5,"Great phone, couldn't be more pleased!","My premium smart phone bit the dust and I needed one immediately, so I bought the Moto G5 plus as a temporary replacement, but this phone is amazing! It does everything my expensive phone did, and cost less than half the price! I'll be keeping this one for a while. Awesome phone."
"June 10, 2017",5,Phone,It is a great phone and lasts long. Surprising light and runs surprising fast as well.
"June 10, 2017",5,Great device; good price,"Phone seems to work perfectly, camera is great. There were reviews complaining about the camera in low light but I think it works quite well. I am so happy no to have all kinds of pre-loaded useless apps. Though I don't like google photos. Like other google apps, it's very invasive and you need to do some exercises to work around it. But the physical device is a winner!"
"June 9, 2017",5,No complaints.,"Responsive, nice display, no noticeable bloatware. At less than half the price of flagship devices, I wonder why I would ever want anything more expensive"
"June 9, 2017",5,great phone,"no need to spend $600 
this is phone has all the features I need & more"
"June 9, 2017",5,Incredible Value,"The price, memory and hardware combination is really great. The battery is also great as it can last all day long easy. Of course the camera could be better but then the pricing would have to match a better camera."
"June 9, 2017",5,Fantastic unlocked phone!,"If you are looking for a quick replacement phone on a budget, but don't want to skimp on performance or features, buy this phone! Seriously nothing else at this price point will get you an octa core CPU, 64GB storage, 4GB RAM, and a fantastic display without a carrier subsidy. Add to that a headphone jack, nice size and weight, and the only thing missing is a removable battery. That is the only downside for me. Period. No carrier/vendor UI customizations beyond a few easily disabled Moto functions, and you have the gamut of Android launchers and programs to use without wasted ROM space or storage."
"June 9, 2017",4,Really great phone with one small flaw,"The Moto G 5 Plus with 64 Gigs of Rom/ 4 Gigs of Ram is a fast processing phone. The Snapdragon 625 Cpu is not only fast processor, but has a proven record to manage battery life. It has pretty decent cameras, both front and back. If you turn on the Moto Gestures, you'll find them very intuitive over time. 
This phone is also universally unlocked, which means it's ready to use for any cell phone carrier. The only significant flaw I see is that it has no NFC chip, so you can't use mobile payments."
"June 9, 2017",4,Real nice phone,"Although I struggled getting the SIM installed once I got it going it has operated like a dream ever since

Love this phone"
"June 9, 2017",5,Great phone,Love this phone. Much better than my Samsung phone I had previously
"June 9, 2017",5,Awesome phone,"Totally worth every penny, you can buy another unlocked phone for such a great deal."
"June 9, 2017",5,Meets and exceeds overall expectations.,"For the price point this phone has surpassed all expectations. Performance, durability and ease of use make this phone well worth the price point. Picture quality far exceeds some of the comments seen in other reviews. Battery life is outstanding."
"June 9, 2017",4,Excellent mid-priced phone,"My wife likes all features (very fast, nice screen, etc.) except speaker-phone is hard to hear."
"June 9, 2017",5,Best smartphone for the money,Best battery life of any new phone. Fast and easy interface home key. Great phone for the price.
"June 8, 2017",5,One Great Basic Smartphone,"This phone is great, went back and purchased a second. Does everything just fine."
"June 7, 2017",5,Nice Phone,"This phone is pretty nice and is super fast. Very pleased,."
"June 6, 2017",5,Great for an inexpensive phone,Great performer for the price. My only complaint is the omission of nfc
"June 6, 2017",5,Great phone!,I thought because of the price this would be a terrible phone but I was pleasantly surprised. The phone is very responsive and the battery last all day with normal use.
"June 6, 2017",4,Good phone with lots of features,This is a good phone at a great price. I purchased it for my wife to replace her Samsung S5.
"June 5, 2017",5,Excellent and affordable!,"I have tried Moto G4, and it was my first option, but when I looked for that, the G5 was on sale, so I checked the specs and differences, and I decided to buy it at an excellent price! It is equipped with the latest Android version."
"June 4, 2017",5,Best option for the money,"Is good looking, plenty of RAM memory (4 Gb) very good battery duration (all day long), good camera and display."
"June 4, 2017",5,Best option for the money,"Motorola - Moto G Plus (5th Gen) 4G LTE with 64GB - Lunar Gray
Is good looking, plenty of RAM memory (4 Gb) very good battery duration (all day long), good camera and display."
"June 3, 2017",5,Great budget phone,I went to my local best buy and got this phone. Its great. It even has special gesture.
"June 3, 2017",4,Excellent Value,I purchased this phone to replace my Nexus 5. Two weeks in and I love this phone. Excellent value for money.
"June 2, 2017",4,Phone works great.,"Very easy to learn how to use, bought phone unlocked, right price, right features."
"June 2, 2017",4,Good so far,Don't like how voicemail works and notifications. Not very good instructions for use of phone. Like how it keeps your windows active and you can switch right back without reactivating.
"June 2, 2017",5,"Phone is OK, service was great","I forgot her name but....
The price of the phone was the same as amazon and newegg. I was hoping that buying it from BB would add the possibility of help transferring contact, etc. This was true. I can't remember her name, but she works at the Bailey's Crossroads BB. She was VERY VERY helpful with pairing the old phone and setting up the new phone. It made a huge difference for me."
"June 2, 2017",5,Great phone for a great price,Phone works very well has a good battery life and can do everything the high end phones can do for a great price
"June 2, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,"This phone has probably the best specs for the price. I'm new to Android and have a few complaints about the software, but the phone itself is nice."
"June 2, 2017",4,Works well.,"It's a very good phone. I didn't give it 5 stars, because the screen size is not big enough and there is little variety in sizes."
"June 2, 2017",4,Good phone,Good phone. I like Motorola phone's. I would get another one
"June 2, 2017",5,Good phone and good value,This does everything I need with room for growth. A big improvement over the 3rd gen phone that I had.
"June 2, 2017",5,Excellent Smart Phone,Excellent phone with great sound and picture quality. It was not full of Apps that I did not want or need. The first Verizon Store staff was not trained to switch my service to an unlocked phone. I went to a Verizon Corporate Store and they switched my phones very easily.
"June 2, 2017",5,Plenty of storage,Only had for a week so far pretty awesome only had to charge once so far camera is bad a$$ pretty fast apps
"June 2, 2017",5,Phone,"I recently bought a new phone that was a ""flagship"" model but because of an accident had to get another new phone. Being somewhat frugal I didn't want to spend top dollar another top end phone and decided to give this one a try. For the money ($299) I couldn't be happier. It has more internal memory than my last phone and seems to run just as smoothly."
"June 2, 2017",5,Great phone at good price,"If you're not after the flagship products, this is a really good Android phone at an unbeatable price."
"June 2, 2017",5,Good Bye BLU Hello Moto,"Was so frustrated with the BLU Vivo 5R phone purchased last year that I walked into Best Buy to pick up an online purchase but headed to the phone section....Pointed at the Moto G 5 Plus, bought it and have loved it ever since. The phone is loud enough to hear it ringing and voices on speakerphone....which was the BIG problem with the BLU phone. The Moto G 5Plus is a really great phone, easy to use and does everything the more expensive phones do. Glad I got it."
"June 2, 2017",5,Love this phone,I sold my broken iPhone 6 and bought this phone. I've loved it so far. I highly recommend getting the 4gb version tho. I don't do any heavy loads and my average ram usage is around 1.9 gb. So you might notice some bottlenecking I'd you only get the 2 gb
"June 2, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,"Very full-featured phone that does all the things you really want for much lower price than the highly advertised phones. For those that don't need endless gimmicks but want solid performance, a good camera and you don't have a bunch of bloated apps pre-installed. If you are looking to show off the latest fads look elsewhere and you'll pay for them. If you want a good phone look here."
"June 2, 2017",5,expectations met,"I'm still learning how to use some of the features, but am very happy with the phone thus far."
"May 29, 2017",4,Nice memory,Nice phone for the price. Nice amount of memory. Good phone for the price.
"May 29, 2017",5,Another GREAT Phone by Motorola,"Phone is great, my 2nd Motorola smartphone and first unlocked phone. LOVE IT!!! The gold color is welcome change from standard black or silver."
"May 29, 2017",5,Excellent phone for the price,Fast processor. Really glad upgraded to 8gb RAM & 64gb internal storage. Plus has micro SD slot too! Switched from my old Note2 and couldn't be happier.
"May 28, 2017",5,Getting used to this new phone,"So far...I think I like it. Only have it a week. I am not a technical person, so figuring things out is taking some time. I go to Youtube to see how to work the phone, since the pamphlet that came with the phone is very sparse on instructions. My grandkids are going to have to help me navigate. I bought this phone based on the reviews of others. The long battery life is a big plus. So is charging the phone...it goes very quickly. Best Buy people were the best experience of getting the phone...they transferred the contact list and photos to the new phone. They were patient and kind with me. I highly recommend them."
"May 27, 2017",5,Great smartphone at a budget price,This is a budget smartphone when you look at the $299 price tag. When you look at the features and capabilities of this phone it compares to the iPhones and Samsung phones which all cost twice as much as this one. This phone has the ability to use a microSD card to expand the internal storage and the 64GB model also has 4GB of RAM which makes this phone fast and responsive. Definitely worth getting.
"May 27, 2017",5,Great phone for the price,This is a great phone for a budget price. I've seen quite a few reviews calling out the call quality. That is user error. If your carrier doesn't support volLTE simply go into settings and turn lte off. You will still have lte for data and your call quality will be wonderful.
"May 27, 2017",5,excelent cell phone,"i am very satisfied for the general atention, the seller information and the variety of products"
"May 26, 2017",4,Great phone specs for the price,"Great phone for the price with awesome 64GB memory with 4GB RAM - compelling configuration with awesome performance. All for $299. Make sure to add a geek squad warranty to protect the screen. 
Pros:
Has latest Nougat OS and has powerful features like gestures handling, rear camera good, SD 256gb extension.
Cons:
Mediocre front camera, gorilla glass 2 used which is not strong - hence warranty needed- Bluetooth connectivity poor sound quality ok, USB 2.0 charging wire onesided connector."
"May 26, 2017",5,Great cellphone,"Fast, good battery life, full HD and Android 7. Perfect"
"May 26, 2017",5,Best phone I've ever had!,64 GB of storage meets my needs. 4 GB of memory is great. Everything about the phone meets my expectations!
"May 26, 2017",5,fast and has nice features on solid hardware,"The MotoG5 just a week or two in is a fast, solid phone with a lot of features to like.
I am switching from a Windows phone where I had excellent, seamless link to my outlook account including calendar and contacts whereas on Android, Outlook is lacking features and syncing to Android calendar, contacts, messaging etc is a challenge.
For one who is comfortable in the Android world this phone is a good value for the $$"
"May 26, 2017",5,Excellent Midrange Phone,Wife loves this phone. Had to purchase it after her LG Nexus 5x bricked on her. The nexus 5x was repaired under warranty but she prefers the Moto. She was real happy to get an FM radio back.
"May 26, 2017",4,good telephone,"Good telephone, simple but practical. No too expensive and easy to use"
"May 26, 2017",5,Bang for the buck,"This is my third Moto G series phone and it is fantastic. Very snappy performance. I personally like the way it looks, though some have said it is too boring. This phone makes it hard to justify spending Samsung or Apple type money!"
"May 21, 2017",3,Close to full featured,"Many top features, very useable. Negatives: no WiFi calling even though it's a brand new model, speaker somewhat weak, still no Android update."
"May 21, 2017",5,"For an Unlocked Ph, this is The BEST for the $","My 1st digital cell phone was (after 2 analog prepaid phones) a Motorola Razer, it lasted yrs 6-8 til I couldn't find replacement batteries for it (which is the only thing I don't like about smart phones). I bought my next 2 cheap Smart Phone (due to hard times over a 2 yr period) just to get by & have a cell phone (but still on a Talk & Text only plan). Once I upgraded my ph plan & started using the Internet, 4 mos later, my 2nd phone's battery got fat from charging (1st from drop damage). So I've spent twice the $ cost each Smart Phone I've purchased in upgrading (cause of better times).
Now that I am back to a Moto phone, I am hoping my phone last as long as my 1st Moto. I am in my early 60's and learning how to navigate the phone is different from the two Blu smart phones I had , like the driving difference between left hand car's & right hand cars (USA vs UK). This phone was only released 2 months before I bought it. Reviews were mixed in my study to purchase, but with the help of my extended warranty, I have overcome the troubles of understanding & use of my phone (but still have challenges).
The ONLY Troubles I have is my service provider crying the blues I didn't by a locked phone. I sometimes have to go back and forth from them to Best Buy to get my problems resolved, due to the fact I also use a wireless headset & smart watch (needs by road law's & warehouse work, where neither one wants to see the phone in my hand).
But after several months of use, and knowing my phone was made by a very reputable company (Motorola) w/Lenovo ownership (the computer cell phones use), I have VERY High hopes this phone will last me for as many yrs as my last Motorola."
"May 21, 2017",5,"Love the phone, very swift",This phone is a great one. Very simply and quick in response
"May 20, 2017",5,My son's first smart phone,"My son was ready to go from his flip phone to a smart phone. He mainly texts and uses social media and loves it. Easy to use, really good camera, great phone."
"May 20, 2017",5,Never going to buy another brand,"Does just what I need a phone to do, all the bells and whistles need to get things done!"
"May 20, 2017",5,Awesome device,"Bought this phone about five days ago, bought it to replace my broken Galaxy S7. Read a few review saying it was pretty good obviously not a flagship..

While technically it is not on paper. It seems like it is The phone is awesome. super .responsive, using it in comparison to my Galaxy S7 that suffered physical, damage. it is way more responsive. It opens applications faster I noticed much less stutter everything seems to run smoother. This is likely related to the near stock Android on it.

The camera does not perform as well in low-light but I would say daytime pictures I've tested with it or just as good as a gs-7. And that lack of a notification light is kind of a pain. but the lock screen notifications do work fairly well.

Using the fingerprint unlock for gestures to get rid of the on-screen Keys is a brilliant idea by Motorola.
Takes a little getting used to but just having this phone for less than a week I'm already used to it and I appreciate the reclaimed screen real estate.

I purchase the 4 gigabyte 64 gigabyte version of this phone which is what I would recommend for the added memory and Storage, for the $300 this phone is absolutely a solid solid solid replacement for a flagship phone.

Bottom line if the phone had OIS for the camera, and just a notification light, it would be one of the best phones I ever used. I'm still giving it 5 stars because it deserves that for the price and the quality of the device and just the user experience."
"May 20, 2017",5,camera is less than stellar,i bought this phone and the camera is less than stellar. also the wifi calling sometimes drops out. it needs a software update
"May 19, 2017",4,Overall its good,"Overall its good, the camera performance is good. and recommend to friends & families"
"May 19, 2017",5,Good,Nice phone with 64 gb mem and 4 gb ram. Working great.
"May 19, 2017",4,Fantastic Budget Phone,"This phone hosts many premium features found on flagships at a much more affordable price with a nearly vanilla Android experience. The addition of a fingerprint scanner and a metal body to the Moto G line were an excellent choice by Lenovo and serve to bolster the quality feel of this device. Furthermore the unlocked support for all 4 major carriers makes this a safe choice for those contemplating switching providers. My only negative is its slightly less attractive appearance. Fortunately, this is easily amended by using any number of stylish cases available. If you are looking at phones in the $200-400 price range, look no further than this one."
"May 19, 2017",5,Great phone no matter the price,"This phone rocks! It is super responsive. Takes great photo's and has a ton of storage. And oh, it does a really good job at being a cell phone."
"May 19, 2017",5,Amazing high end phone at a low end price,"super fast. 4G LTE on T-mobile worked without a glitch. Pure Android with minimal bloatware. great price, not sure why people go for Samsung when phones like this are almost half the cost"
"May 19, 2017",5,High End at a budget,"Don't be fooled by the price. This budget phone packs impressive hardware into a nicely sized phone. It's very fast and would make a fantastic backup or primary phone. Don't hesitate, for the price, no other phone comes close in specs. Highly recommended."
"May 17, 2017",4,Good nothing special,Good specs at a good price but nothing flashy about it
"May 17, 2017",5,Beautiful phone,"I love this phone, very fast. The only negative is keep in mind the camera is not high end, meaning in door / low light pictures are not great. But can't beat it for the price."
"May 17, 2017",5,Excellent phone for the price,I purchased this phone to replace a Samsung S4 that was having issues. This phone has worked so well. It is a great size and has great features. I did have to order a case and screen protector online as they didn't have them available in store.
"May 17, 2017",4,"Great Phone, but..","i was expected more accesories in BB.

Overall, its a great phone, a good O.S. and the performance as far as i use the cell, its good."
"May 17, 2017",5,Better than a Samsung,"Honestly, I can't think of a reason to buy a Samsung S8 over this phone, it does everything great and the price is RIGHT and it works on every carrier! I'm paying attention to Motorola now!"
"May 17, 2017",5,Awesome,Awesome. Awesome product glad I bought the 64 gig with the extra RAM the phone is phenomenal screen resolution to fingerprint scanner to speed of processor not what you expect out of how much you actually pay for the phone reconstruction overall would definitely recommend to others as it unlocked phone purchase
"May 16, 2017",5,Excellent budget priced - full featured phone,The Moto G5 Plus carries the style and reliability I came to expect from my old Moto G. Easy to set-up and use yet faster with far more memory capacity for current app needs. A satisfying purchase.
"May 16, 2017",4,Great phone,Great phone little over priced but worth it. Got it for my son tried out 2 others before this this one was the fastest but more.
"May 16, 2017",4,Good mid-range phone with advanced features!,"Overall a great phone, it's fast, has a great camera, and is unlocked with no carrier bloatware! I've had two minor issues: 1) Headphone jack is a bit picky which headphones will work with it. 2) fingerprint scanner is quick but doesn't recognize fingers very well - especially if phone is warm (e.g. while charging). Otherwise I'm very pleased with it!"
"May 15, 2017",4,Good Phone,I like moto phones. i used moto g2 earlier. now i got this moto g5. this phone is good except if many apps are open then browsing is little bit slow.
"May 14, 2017",4,Great Bargain,This phone is the best bang-for-the-buck you will find.
"May 14, 2017",4,Moto,How can anyone fault an unlocked cellphone? Especially one that features 4MB of ROM & 64 GB of onboard storage! WooHoo!
"May 12, 2017",5,Love it!,Probably the best value out there for the price with most of the great features of the more expensive phones. Definitely worth checking it out.
"May 12, 2017",4,My first smart phone,"I have always been a flip phone user but needed this for a golf app. Still learning, but love it."
"May 12, 2017",5,Great phone,Had great help choosing the phone by Best Buy associate
"May 12, 2017",5,Good and affordable phone,"The phone is a good size, nice screen and a good price"
"May 12, 2017",4,Solid Android Phone,Having had several other Android devices I settled on this one after reviews at GSM Arena. The 64GB model is the better option. I have 3 of these devices - 2 x 64GB and 1 x 32GB. The ability to have the SD card formatted as internal memory essentially frees up more headroom. The device has its quirks but overall a great agnostic choice for under $300. Not that it makes a difference but I have 2 on T-Mobile and 1 on Verizon which should convince you of the utility of the device. Good buy!
"May 12, 2017",5,Excellent price quality relation,Excellent phone. I found it very fast to respond. It's elegant but is robust too.
"May 12, 2017",5,King of the budget phones,"Excellent value for the money. Very good battery life, exceptional screen, and the finger print sensor is a bonus. This phone does not feel like a budget phone but instead a flag ship."
"May 12, 2017",4,Great cam,"Great phone for the money,great camera,fast processing.."
"May 12, 2017",5,great quality and performance,"Good phone, great quality and performance. Battery runs for almost 2 days. Camera is great and all apps and Android OS run smoothly."
"May 10, 2017",4,Decent basic phone,Decent basic smartphone. It's no flagship phone but it gets the job done for people who don't need the best and most expensive on the market. Runs Android 7.0 and I am downgrading the phone because of this. Not sure when it will get 7.1. Cannot run the Boxer email app for the phone for some unknown reason. Only comes with the Gmail email app. Best Buy has no screen protectors in the store and only one style of a case.
"May 9, 2017",5,Great In All Respects,I expected this phone to be a placeholder until I buy a premium device. To my surprise I am probably going to stick with this phone until the battery degrades. Phones in this price range are going to have to be acknowledged moving forward.
"May 9, 2017",5,Best Motorola phone yet,"I was super impressed with the Moto 3, but this phone has taken Motorola to a whole other level!"
"May 8, 2017",5,Great phone for a great price!,"Love this phone! It is fast, works well, has a great camera & screen. Only issue I've had with it is the fingerprint scanner does not work reliably when the phone is plugged in & charging."
"May 7, 2017",3,Not Perfect,Not perfect but not to the extent that it would make this a bad purchase. A plus for this phone is very good battery life.
"May 7, 2017",5,go buy it,The phone looks good and works as expected. Camera is great. Price is reasonable for the features we get.
"May 7, 2017",5,Exceptional value,"Great build quality, decent camera and almost stock Android. By far the best budget Android device"
"May 6, 2017",3,Good deal,Purchased this for my little sister. It is a mid level phone with some good specs. If you do not need the latest processor and best camera (although it's a solid 7 out of 10) grab this phone
"May 6, 2017",5,"Great phone, Unbelievable Price","Headline says it all. Plus the minimal messing with Android by Motorola is refreshing. No bloatware, no unnecessary apps, etc. Fast, clean, awesome pix, under $300 and unlocked for ANY carrier...Love it!"
"May 6, 2017",5,Comparable to the Samsung Gallaxy S4,It does have a great camera. It is a bit large for little hands.it has a spacious internal memory and SD card memory. Overall a nice phone; also has the 4k capability.
"May 5, 2017",3,Good phone except signal,"Good phone except signal very low when in my office. Other people can not contact me at work. I use At&t; network, other people use At&t; but they have good signal with different phone. I bought this phone simply because I am fan of Motorola..."
"May 5, 2017",5,Great phone,"Great phone, beautiful pictures, perfect in every way."
"May 5, 2017",5,Awesome phone,This is phone is amazing and I recommend it to everyone!
"May 2, 2017",5,Great phone.,"Coming from the LG G5, I wanted to get a great unlocked phone and I got just that, a great unlocked cell phone. *If you use this phone with Verizon, you have to know how to manipulate the phone settings."
"May 1, 2017",5,Definitely worth the money,"Best battery life you'll find on any phone! Even though it's not a top of the line processor, it multi-tasks very well."
"April 29, 2017",5,Awesome,"The phone has an impressive battery life, the camera is decent, and the performance is smooth. I've had the phone for almost a month and it hasn't given me any trouble. I'm coming from an LG G5 and I didn't see a noticeable difference in performance, given the LG has a Snapdragon 820 and this one the 625. The only cons would be the lack of NFC and the micro USB charging port."
"April 28, 2017",5,It Meets My Needs,I bought this for my wife to replace her Moto G 1st Gen. She loves it. I'm glad we waited for this phone. She is using it with Cricket Wireless. this phone uses the Nano sized SIM. The old phone used a different size. It only cost $10 to purchase the new SIM. This phone is perfect for my wife's phone needs.
"April 28, 2017",5,Enjoy more than my s7,Even better than expected. Find better to use than my Galaxy S7
"April 28, 2017",4,No dual speakers,"My Moto G 2nd Gen cell phone had great dual speakers. I didn't notice till I had this phone for a week that it only has one speaker, Big disappointment. Also there is lag time between hitting a number and the sound it makes which sometimes causes it not to go forward to where I'm trying to go."
"November 19, 2017",4,So far as promised...,"Good price for a phone that seems to live up to battery life and functionality. It appears to have some flagship advantages for a mid-range. Speed hasn't let me down yet. I would buy this phone as a daily driver that wouldn't absolutely devastate me if lost, broken or stolen, but that is far better than a cheap phone with low resolution and a weak camera. Feels right for what I wanted."
"November 17, 2017",4,Great phone for price,"Only con, slows down when when multiple apps/browsers running at the same time, 3or more. Other than that looks good, and works good"
"November 16, 2017",5,Excellent phone,Extremely fast. Feels like good quality and the battery lasts all day.
"September 20, 2017",2,Wasnt a fan of this phone,Although i am a loyal fan of Motorola this fan did not meet my expectations. Returned it for the Moto Z play.
"July 28, 2017",4,Great for the pice,"This is a pretty decent phone for the price. I had the Moto x pure previous to this phone and they are fairly on par with each other with was a bit of a disappointment that in 3 years Moto's mid unlocked phone hasn't improved alot. The camera is much better, the screen is worse processor is slower but has more threads graphics is worse and battery is better."
"July 19, 2017",5,great budget phone,"phone works flawlessly. I bought it to replace my Samsung S7. only part that isn't better, is the camera. it works well, but the best camera. don't get me wrong, it takes nice pictures. works great considering the price of the phone."
"June 12, 2017",1,Terrible,"Maybe the issue was just with my phone but the speaker did not work, callers were unable to hear me without a headset, and the camera resolution was just terrible."
"June 8, 2017",1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this phone when my droid turbo was wearing out. But it was a complete waste of money. The phone kept cutting in and out and people had trouble hearing me, even when I had great reception. It was slow too. I barely had any apps or anything on the phone and it was already really slow. And the battery life was poor. I had to recharge it by early evening and I wasn't using it all that much. I returned it to the store after 10 days and was charged a $35 restocking fee. It is junk. Don't buy it."
"May 28, 2017",4,Good phone,Excellent phone for the money. Camera is decent but not good in low light.
"April 30, 2017",2,Good but it is not enough,"Cons: Lost signal very fast and in continue way. I bought it for Uber and Lift, working with my iPad at the same time with AT&T; plan. iPad rarely lost signal, but this Moto G5 lost signal often in the middle of my work! oh may!
In addition, maps and similar applications have not room to run properly
Pros: Price, fast, memory, and last Nougat system. I am loving Android applications"
"April 6, 2017",4,Great hardware for the price. Some Software Bugs,Responsive phone and google assistant works well. Unfortunately there are some bugs in android 7.0 that will cause apps to freeze or not work. After a day of usage it is normal for me to have to restart the phone before google assistant will start working again. I do not know if this phone is eligible for software updates. Solid camera for the price but not as good as the online reviews make it out to be.
"May 20, 2017",3,Worth it,"I bought this product from Best Buy, their service is always the best. This phone is Worth that cost and simple high end phone."
"October 18, 2017",2,Lemon,Ive just had a ton of problems with mine. Pretty much anything that can go wrong has. It's not major things though
"August 1, 2017",3,"not sure how to work this phone, having problems","not sure how to work this phone, having problems , need help"
"July 13, 2017",1,"Do not buy, $400 down the drain.","This phone is %100 pure trash. Sluggish, flimsy, no frills and annoying. Has alot of annoying features, one example is when you open up the settings menu at the top is shows 3/4 of the screen of suggestions that really isnt a suggestion its more wanting to force you into using a few features that are worthless but Motorola needs you to turn them on to somehow validate thier existence. If that not enough when of if you do find the setting you want its poorly placed. I have the 4g ram version and somehow the phone still is pathetically slow. Sad construction, because the phone is such a pile of garbage you'll be inclined to throw it......often. Beware its not a real metal cased phone and if you sneeze on the screen the glass will break. Ive had several phones for under half the price of this that were better in every way."
"June 16, 2017",1,Didn't work,Salesperson ruined my old phone when they put the SIM card back in. Can only be used like a tablet now. Can't call or text. Probably won't come back. NOT HAPPY!
"April 20, 2017",1,Forget the 'Phone' and 'Smart' in Smartphone,"I never write negative reviews, but this one deserves it. I have had this device for about a week and I am terribly disappointed. Call volume levels and call quality are lacking 90% of the time and the volume during calls fluctuates at random no matter if I am using the phone at home or if I am out and about. Camera is 'ok' - nothing to compare to what Lenvo / Motorola stated on paper. It may be the best in it's class, but low light photography is null and void as far as performance is concerned, however outside and during the day the camera takes beautiful shots. Just don't use it indoors or low light. Contacted motorola about phone volume issue and ran diagnostics per their support site beforehand and I was told there was nothing they could test further. I was recommended by Motorola to return the hardware defective handset. After researching the issue online, motorola is known for low call volume issues and in my opinion should no longer be offered as a 'smartphone' it's really not that smart or works well as a phone. Just my two bits."
"May 7, 2017",1,"Returned to store, not liked","This product cannot compare favorably with Samsung or LG.
Inferior in many ways. I returned it and bought Samsung phone which is far superior and works great."
"July 1, 2017",1,too complcated,"I'm no tecki but I'm also no dummy, and this phone makes it hard to do the most simple task like looking up messages or trying to get your voicemails. I wished I spent more time and asked more questions !!!!"
"April 10, 2017",2,Doesn't Link,"I picked these 2 phones up today and they look like a great deal, but it does not link with our bluetooth in our 2015 VW and It does not work with Verizon Cloud. I am taking them back."
"March 31, 2017",1,NOT ON VERIZON,"Bought the phone after it said it worked on Verizon, however when I called in they said it cannot be activated on Verizon. Just in case they were wrong, I also brought it into a Verizon store and they also looked up the phone and they said the same thing. 
So, don't buy this phone for use on Verizon."
